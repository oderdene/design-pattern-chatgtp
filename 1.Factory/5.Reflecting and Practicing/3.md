### **🛠 Small Projects to Practice the Factory Design Pattern**  

Here are some **beginner-friendly projects** that will help you practice the **Factory Pattern** in a meaningful way. Each project focuses on a different aspect of the pattern.

---

## **1️⃣ Project: Shape Factory 🟢🔺🔳**
**📝 Goal:** Create a simple **Shape Factory** that generates different geometric shapes (Circle, Square, Triangle) and calls a `draw()` method.

**🔹 Features to Implement:**
✅ A `Shape` interface with a `draw()` method.  
✅ Concrete classes (`Circle`, `Square`, `Triangle`).  
✅ A **Factory Class** to create shapes dynamically.  
✅ A **Client Program** that requests different shapes.  

**🔹 Sample Implementation (Java):**
```java
// Step 1: Define Shape Interface
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

// Step 2: Implement Concrete Shape Classes
class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Square");
    }
}

class Triangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Triangle");
    }
}

// Step 3: Create the Shape Factory
class ShapeFactory {
    public static Shape createShape(String type) {
        return switch (type.toLowerCase()) {
            case "circle" -> new Circle();
            case "square" -> new Square();
            case "triangle" -> new Triangle();
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown shape type");
        };
    }
}

// Step 4: Client Code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape1 = ShapeFactory.createShape("circle");
        shape1.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Circle

        Shape shape2 = ShapeFactory.createShape("square");
        shape2.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Square
    }
}
```
**🔹 What You'll Learn:**  
✔ How to **replace `new` with a Factory**  
✔ How to **add new shapes easily** (Extensibility)  
✔ How to **centralize object creation**

## **2️⃣ Project: Notification Sender (Email, SMS, Push) 📩📲**
**📝 Goal:** Build a **Notification Factory** that dynamically selects how notifications are sent.

**🔹 Features to Implement:**
✅ A `NotificationSender` interface with a `send()` method.  
✅ Implement **EmailSender, SMSSender, PushNotificationSender**.  
✅ A **Factory** that selects the appropriate sender.  
✅ A **Client Program** that sends notifications dynamically.

## **3️⃣ Project: Animal Factory 🐶🐱🐦**
**📝 Goal:** Create a factory that generates different **Animal objects**.

**🔹 Features to Implement:**
✅ A `Animal` interface with a `speak()` method.  
✅ Concrete classes (`Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`).  
✅ A **Factory Class** to create animals dynamically.  
✅ A **Client Program** that interacts with animals.

**🔹 Example Output:**
```
Dog: Woof!
Cat: Meow!
Bird: Tweet!
```

## **4️⃣ Project: Payment Gateway Factory 💳**
**📝 Goal:** Create a **Payment Factory** that supports different payment methods (PayPal, Stripe, Bank Transfer).

**🔹 Features to Implement:**
✅ A `PaymentProcessor` interface with a `processPayment()` method.  
✅ Implement `PayPalProcessor`, `StripeProcessor`, `BankTransferProcessor`.  
✅ A **Factory Class** to create the appropriate processor.  
✅ A **Client Program** that processes payments dynamically.

---

## **5️⃣ Project: File Parser Factory 📄**
**📝 Goal:** Build a **File Parser Factory** that supports different file types (CSV, JSON, XML).

**🔹 Features to Implement:**
✅ A `FileParser` interface with a `parse()` method.  
✅ Implement **CSVParser, JSONParser, XMLParser**.  
✅ A **Factory Class** to return the appropriate parser.  
✅ A **Client Program** that selects a parser dynamically.

### **🚀 Which One Should You Start With?**
✔ If you are new to Factory Pattern → **Start with the Shape Factory 🟢🔺🔳**  
✔ If you want real-world applications → **Try the Notification Sender 📩 or Payment Processor 💳**  
✔ If you want to work with external data → **File Parser Factory 📄**
