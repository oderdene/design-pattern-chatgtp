## 24.	What questions remain unclear about this pattern after learning it?


### **Common Unclear Questions About the Factory Design Pattern ü§î**  

After learning about the **Factory Design Pattern**, developers often still have **some doubts** or **confusion**. Here are the **most common remaining questions**, along with **clarifications** to help solidify your understanding.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ When Should I Use the Factory Pattern vs. Just Using `new`?**
### **ü§î Question:**  
If I can just use `new ClassName()`, why would I need a factory?  

### **‚úÖ Answer:**  
Use **`new` (direct instantiation) when:**
- The object creation is **simple** and doesn‚Äôt involve dependencies.
- You only need **one specific class** (e.g., always `new Car()`).

Use **Factory Pattern when:**
- You need to **switch between different implementations dynamically**.
- Object creation involves **complex logic** (e.g., setting up dependencies).
- You want to follow **Open/Closed Principle** (adding new types without modifying existing code).

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Is Factory Pattern the Same as Singleton?**
### **ü§î Question:**  
How is **Factory different from Singleton**? Both seem to control object creation.  

### **‚úÖ Answer:**  
üîπ **Factory Pattern** creates **new instances** (or pooled objects).  
üîπ **Singleton Pattern** ensures **only one instance** of a class exists.  

üö® **Example Difference:**
```java
// Factory (Creates multiple objects)
DatabaseConnection conn1 = ConnectionFactory.getConnection();
DatabaseConnection conn2 = ConnectionFactory.getConnection(); // New object

// Singleton (Always returns the same object)
DatabaseConnection conn1 = DatabaseSingleton.getInstance();
DatabaseConnection conn2 = DatabaseSingleton.getInstance(); // Same object
```
‚úÖ **Solution:** If you need **controlled, dynamic object creation**, use **Factory**.  
‚úÖ If you need **only one shared instance**, use **Singleton**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ What If I Need to Pass Parameters to Objects?**
### **ü§î Question:**  
How do I handle cases where objects need **custom configurations**, like setting a name or ID?  

### **‚úÖ Answer:**  
Factories **work well** with the **Builder Pattern** for customization.  

üö® **Bad Example (Factory Without Customization)**
```java
User user = UserFactory.createUser(); // Always returns default User
```

‚úÖ **Better Approach: Factory + Builder**
```java
User user = UserFactory.createUser().setName("Alice").setAge(25).build();
```
This lets the factory provide **a base object**, and the builder allows **customization**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Should Factory Methods Be Static or Instance Methods?**
### **ü§î Question:**  
Should the factory methods be **static (`static create()`)** or should I **instantiate the factory first (`new Factory().create()`)**?  

### **‚úÖ Answer:**  
üîπ **Use Static Methods (`public static create()`)** when:  
‚úî Object creation logic is **simple and doesn't need dependencies**.  
‚úî The factory **doesn‚Äôt store state** (e.g., `ShapeFactory.createShape("circle")`).  

üîπ **Use an Instance Factory (`new Factory().create()`)** when:  
‚úî The factory **needs configuration** (e.g., `ConnectionFactory` with DB credentials).  
‚úî You want **Dependency Injection**.  

üö® **Example Difference:**
```java
// Static Factory (Simple & Stateless)
User user = UserFactory.createUser();

// Instance Factory (Configurable)
UserFactory factory = new UserFactory(config);
User user = factory.createUser();
```

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Can I Use Factory with Dependency Injection (DI)?**
### **ü§î Question:**  
Does Factory work well with **Spring, Dagger, or other DI frameworks**?  

### **‚úÖ Answer:**  
YES! **Factory Pattern + DI** is a **powerful combination**. Instead of manually calling the factory, let **Spring manage it**.

üîπ **Spring Example:**
```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    private final UserFactory userFactory;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserFactory userFactory) {
        this.userFactory = userFactory;
    }

    public void processUser() {
        User user = userFactory.createUser();
        // Business logic...
    }
}
```
‚úÖ **Now the factory is injected automatically**, making your system **more modular and testable**.

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Is Factory Pattern Slow? Does It Affect Performance?**
### **ü§î Question:**  
Since Factory adds an **extra method call**, does it slow down performance?  

### **‚úÖ Answer:**  
In **most applications**, the overhead of a factory is **negligible**. However:  

üö® **When Factory Might Be a Problem:**  
‚ùå If the factory **always creates new objects**, it can increase **Garbage Collection (GC) overhead**.  
‚ùå If the factory **uses reflection (`Class.forName()`)**, it will be **slower than direct instantiation**.  

‚úÖ **Optimizations to Improve Factory Performance:**  
‚úî Use **Object Pooling** (reuse objects instead of creating new ones).  
‚úî Use **Lazy Initialization** to **delay object creation until needed**.  
‚úî Avoid **Reflection** unless dynamically loading classes.

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ What If I Need a Factory for Multiple Related Objects?**
### **ü§î Question:**  
How do I manage factories when I need to create **multiple related objects** (e.g., Windows UI vs. Mac UI)?  

### **‚úÖ Answer:**  
Use the **Abstract Factory Pattern** for **families of related objects**.

üö® **Bad Example (Multiple Factories)**
```java
Button button = ButtonFactory.createButton("Windows");
Checkbox checkbox = CheckboxFactory.createCheckbox("Windows");
```

‚úÖ **Better Approach (Abstract Factory)**
```java
GUIFactory factory = new WindowsFactory();
Button button = factory.createButton();
Checkbox checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
```
Now, switching from **Windows UI to Mac UI** is **easy**‚Äîjust change the factory!

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ How Do I Test Code That Uses a Factory?**
### **ü§î Question:**  
How do I write unit tests if the code **calls a factory method**?  

### **‚úÖ Answer:**  
- **If Factory Methods Are Static:**  
  - Use a **Mock Factory Class** in tests.  
  - Pass a **fake factory as a dependency**.  

üîπ **Using Dependency Injection to Make Factory Testable**
```java
public class UserService {
    private final UserFactory factory;

    public UserService(UserFactory factory) {
        this.factory = factory;
    }

    public void processUser() {
        User user = factory.createUser();  // Factory is injected, easier to mock
    }
}
```
‚úÖ **Now, in tests, you can inject a mock factory:**  
```java
UserFactory mockFactory = mock(UserFactory.class);
when(mockFactory.createUser()).thenReturn(new User("Test User"));

UserService service = new UserService(mockFactory);
```
Now **unit tests won‚Äôt depend on the real factory**.
