## 6. What are the key components of this design pattern?

The **Factory Design Pattern** consists of the following **key components**:  

### **1️⃣ Product (Interface or Abstract Class) 🎭**  
- Defines a **common interface** for all objects that the factory will create.  
- Ensures that different object types share the same behavior.  

🔹 **Example (Java)**:
```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}
```

---

### **2️⃣ Concrete Products (Implementations) 🔧**  
- These are the **actual objects** that will be created by the factory.  
- Each class implements the product interface.  

🔹 **Example:**
```java
class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Square");
    }
}
```

---

### **3️⃣ Factory (Creator) 🏭**  
- Contains the **object creation logic**.  
- Returns an instance of the correct **Concrete Product** based on input parameters.  

🔹 **Example:**
```java
class ShapeFactory {
    public static Shape getShape(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) return new Circle();
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")) return new Square();
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown shape type");
    }
}
```

---

### **4️⃣ Client (User of the Factory) 👤**  
- Calls the factory to get an object without knowing its exact implementation.  
- Works with the **Product interface**, not concrete classes.  

🔹 **Example:**
```java
public class FactoryPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape1 = ShapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
        shape1.draw();  // Output: Drawing a Circle

        Shape shape2 = ShapeFactory.getShape("SQUARE");
        shape2.draw();  // Output: Drawing a Square
    }
}
```

### **Summary of Key Components**  
| Component        | Role |
|-----------------|------|
| **Product**     | Defines a common interface for objects. |
| **Concrete Product** | Implements the interface, representing actual objects. |
| **Factory (Creator)** | Contains logic to instantiate and return the correct object. |
| **Client**      | Calls the factory to get an object, without knowing its actual class. |
