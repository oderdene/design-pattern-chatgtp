The **Factory Design Pattern** exists to **simplify object creation** and make code **more flexible**. Instead of writing `new` everywhere in your code to create objects, a **factory** handles it for you.  

This helps because:  
1. You don’t have to worry about which exact class to create.  
2. If you need to change or add new object types, you don’t have to modify existing code.  
3. It keeps your code **clean**, **organized**, and **easier to maintain**.  

Think of it like a coffee machine: instead of manually mixing coffee, milk, and sugar, you just press a button, and it gives you the right coffee. The factory does the same—it makes the right object for you! ☕


What problem does this design pattern solve?

The **Factory Design Pattern** solves the problem of **object creation** in a way that promotes **loose coupling** and **scalability**. Instead of directly instantiating classes using `new`, the pattern delegates the responsibility of object creation to a specialized factory class. 

### **Problems It Solves**
1. **Tight Coupling to Concrete Classes**  
   - When a class directly instantiates objects, it depends on specific implementations. This makes it harder to switch to a different implementation.
   - **Solution:** The factory abstracts away the object creation, allowing flexibility in choosing the implementation.

2. **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   - If a class is responsible for both **business logic** and **creating objects**, it takes on multiple responsibilities.
   - **Solution:** The factory pattern moves the creation logic into a separate entity, keeping classes focused on their core tasks.

3. **Difficult Object Management**  
   - If object creation logic is complex (e.g., requiring configurations, dependencies, or subclasses), managing it inside client code leads to duplication and inconsistency.
   - **Solution:** The factory centralizes and standardizes object creation.

4. **Hard to Extend (Open/Closed Principle Violation)**  
   - If new object types need to be introduced, modifying existing code breaks the **Open/Closed Principle**.
   - **Solution:** The factory allows new subclasses or implementations without modifying existing client code.

5. **Complicated Object Initialization**  
   - Some objects require pre-processing, such as setting default values, checking conditions, or fetching dependencies.
   - **Solution:** The factory ensures all required setup is done before returning an object.

### **Example Use Case**
Imagine a system that processes different types of documents (`PDFDocument`, `WordDocument`, `ExcelDocument`). Without a factory, the client code would look like this:

```java
Document doc = new PDFDocument();  // Hardcoded dependency
```
This is inflexible and makes future modifications difficult.

Using the **Factory Pattern**, we can create a `DocumentFactory`:

```java
class DocumentFactory {
    public static Document createDocument(String type) {
        if (type.equals("PDF")) return new PDFDocument();
        if (type.equals("Word")) return new WordDocument();
        if (type.equals("Excel")) return new ExcelDocument();
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown document type");
    }
}
```

Now, the client can get the required document type without worrying about implementation details:

```java
Document doc = DocumentFactory.createDocument("PDF");
```

This makes it **easier to extend**, **maintain**, and **decouple** object creation from the main application logic.
