1. **Abstract Factory** ‚Äì Declares methods for creating related objects.  
2. **Concrete Factories** ‚Äì Implement the abstract factory to create specific product families.  
3. **Abstract Products** ‚Äì Define common interfaces for product types.  
4. **Concrete Products** ‚Äì Specific implementations of the abstract products.  
5. **Client** ‚Äì Uses the abstract factory to create products without depending on concrete classes.



The **Abstract Factory** design pattern has **four key components**, explained simply:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Abstract Factory (Interface or Abstract Class)**
- Defines a **blueprint** for creating related objects.
- Declares methods but **does not implement them**.
- Ensures all factories follow the same structure.

üí° **Example:**  
A **FurnitureFactory** declares methods like `createChair()`, `createTable()`, and `createSofa()`, but doesn‚Äôt actually build them.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Concrete Factories**
- These are the **real factories** that implement the abstract factory.
- Each concrete factory produces a **specific set of related objects**.

üí° **Example:**  
- `ModernFurnitureFactory` creates **ModernChair, ModernTable, ModernSofa**.  
- `VictorianFurnitureFactory` creates **VictorianChair, VictorianTable, VictorianSofa**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Abstract Products (Interfaces or Abstract Classes)**
- Define **a common structure** for product families.
- Ensure that all product variations share common behavior.

üí° **Example:**  
A **Chair** interface has a `sitOn()` method, which all chair types (ModernChair, VictorianChair) must implement.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Concrete Products**
- The actual objects created by the factories.
- Each concrete product belongs to a specific factory.

üí° **Example:**  
- `ModernChair`, `ModernTable`, `ModernSofa` ‚Üí Made by **ModernFurnitureFactory**.  
- `VictorianChair`, `VictorianTable`, `VictorianSofa` ‚Üí Made by **VictorianFurnitureFactory**.  

---

### **How These Components Work Together**
1Ô∏è‚É£ The client requests a **factory** (e.g., ModernFurnitureFactory).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The factory produces **matching products** (e.g., ModernChair, ModernTable).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The client doesn‚Äôt need to worry about **how** the objects are created‚Äîit just uses them.

## 6. What are the key components of abstract factory design pattern?
The **Abstract Factory** design pattern consists of several key components that work together to create families of related objects. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

---

### **1. Abstract Factory (Interface or Abstract Class)**
   - Defines a set of **methods for creating abstract product objects**.
   - Acts as a blueprint for concrete factories.

   **Example (Java)**:
   ```java
   interface GUIFactory {
       Button createButton();
       Checkbox createCheckbox();
   }
   ```

---

### **2. Concrete Factories (Implementations of Abstract Factory)**
   - Provide the **actual implementation** of the factory methods to produce related objects.
   - Ensures that only compatible products are created together.

   **Example (Java)**:
   ```java
   class WindowsFactory implements GUIFactory {
       public Button createButton() { return new WindowsButton(); }
       public Checkbox createCheckbox() { return new WindowsCheckbox(); }
   }

   class MacFactory implements GUIFactory {
       public Button createButton() { return new MacButton(); }
       public Checkbox createCheckbox() { return new MacCheckbox(); }
   }
   ```

---

### **3. Abstract Products (Interfaces or Abstract Classes)**
   - Define common **interfaces for a set of related products**.
   - Ensures that all concrete products follow the same contract.

   **Example (Java)**:
   ```java
   interface Button {
       void render();
   }

   interface Checkbox {
       void render();
   }
   ```

---

### **4. Concrete Products (Implementations of Abstract Products)**
   - Provide the actual implementation of the abstract products.
   - Created by their respective **concrete factories**.

   **Example (Java)**:
   ```java
   class WindowsButton implements Button {
       public void render() { System.out.println("Rendering Windows Button"); }
   }

   class MacButton implements Button {
       public void render() { System.out.println("Rendering Mac Button"); }
   }
   ```

---

### **5. Client Code**
   - Uses the **abstract factory** to create products without knowing the concrete classes.
   - Relies on polymorphism to remain **decoupled from specific implementations**.

   **Example (Java)**:
   ```java
   class Application {
       private Button button;
       private Checkbox checkbox;

       public Application(GUIFactory factory) {
           button = factory.createButton();
           checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
       }

       public void renderUI() {
           button.render();
           checkbox.render();
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **6. Factory Selector (Optional)**
   - Sometimes, a factory selector or configuration logic is used to determine which factory to instantiate.

   **Example (Java)**:
   ```java
   class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           GUIFactory factory;

           // Assume we determine the OS type dynamically
           String os = "Windows"; // Can be "Mac"
           
           if (os.equals("Windows")) {
               factory = new WindowsFactory();
           } else {
               factory = new MacFactory();
           }

           Application app = new Application(factory);
           app.renderUI();
       }
   }
   ```

### **Summary of Key Components**
| **Component**         | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Abstract Factory**  | Defines the creation methods for product families. |
| **Concrete Factories** | Implement the abstract factory and create specific product families. |
| **Abstract Products** | Define a contract that concrete products must follow. |
| **Concrete Products** | Provide actual implementations of the abstract products. |
| **Client Code** | Uses the factory to create objects without knowing their specific classes. |
| **Factory Selector (Optional)** | Helps choose the appropriate factory dynamically. |

### **Final Thoughts**
The **Abstract Factory** pattern is a **creational pattern** that ensures **consistent object creation** while keeping the system **modular and extendable**. By following **SOLID principles**, it promotes loose coupling and maintainability.
