1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** ‚Äì It separates object creation from business logic, ensuring each class has a single responsibility.  
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** ‚Äì New product families can be introduced without modifying existing code.  
3. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** ‚Äì High-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.  
4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** ‚Äì Encapsulates object creation logic, avoiding redundant instantiation code.


The **Abstract Factory** design pattern embodies several important programming principles, including **SOLID** and **DRY** principles. Here‚Äôs how:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ‚Äì (S in SOLID)**  
- The factory is responsible **only** for creating objects‚Äîit **doesn‚Äôt** handle business logic.  
- This keeps the code **clean and organized** by separating concerns.  

üí° **Example:** A car factory only produces cars. It doesn‚Äôt sell them or repair them.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Open/Closed Principle (O in SOLID)**  
- The system is **open for extension but closed for modification**.  
- If you want to add a new type of product (e.g., a new furniture style), you create a **new factory** instead of modifying existing code.  

üí° **Example:** If a furniture store wants to add a new style (Art Deco), they **add** a new factory rather than changing existing factories.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Liskov Substitution Principle (L in SOLID)**  
- The client code should be able to use any factory **without knowing the exact type**.  
- Any **concrete factory** (ModernFurnitureFactory, VictorianFurnitureFactory) can replace the **abstract factory** without breaking the code.  

üí° **Example:** If a customer asks for a "furniture set," they don‚Äôt care **which factory** produces it as long as it works.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Dependency Inversion Principle (D in SOLID)**  
- High-level modules (**clients**) should **not depend on concrete classes** but on abstractions.  
- The client doesn‚Äôt create objects directly‚Äîit asks the **abstract factory** to do it.  

üí° **Example:** A furniture store doesn‚Äôt build chairs themselves; they order from a factory.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)**  
- Instead of **duplicating object creation logic** everywhere, the factory centralizes it in **one place**.  
- This makes maintenance **easier** and **prevents code duplication**.  

üí° **Example:** If all car models need wheels, the factory ensures they are created **once in a standard way** rather than copying the code everywhere.  

### **Conclusion**  
The **Abstract Factory** pattern promotes **clean, maintainable, and scalable code** by following SOLID and DRY principles. It helps separate concerns, avoid duplication, and make adding new products easy **without modifying existing code**. üöÄ



## 5. Which programming principles (e.g., SOLID, DRY) does abstract factory design pattern embody?
The **Abstract Factory** design pattern embodies several fundamental programming principles, particularly from the **SOLID** principles and other best practices like **DRY** and **Separation of Concerns**. Here‚Äôs how:

---

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) [S in SOLID]**
- **Principle:** A class should have only one reason to change.
- **How Abstract Factory Applies:**
  - The factory class is responsible **only for object creation**, not for business logic.
  - This **separates creation logic** from the client code, making maintenance easier.

---

### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) [O in SOLID]**
- **Principle:** A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **How Abstract Factory Applies:**
  - Adding new product families (e.g., a new theme, a new OS UI set) **does not modify existing code**; you simply create a new factory.
  - The existing factories and client code **remain unchanged**.

---

### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) [L in SOLID]**
- **Principle:** Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
- **How Abstract Factory Applies:**
  - The client relies on **abstract interfaces**, meaning it doesn‚Äôt care if it gets a `WindowsButton` or a `MacButton`‚Äîas long as it follows the `Button` interface.
  - This ensures polymorphic behavior without breaking client code.

---

### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) [I in SOLID]**
- **Principle:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **How Abstract Factory Applies:**
  - Instead of a single monolithic interface that creates **everything**, factories are designed to be **specific** (e.g., `GUIFactory` for UI components, `CarFactory` for vehicles).
  - This keeps interfaces **lightweight and focused**.

---

### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) [D in SOLID]**
- **Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **How Abstract Factory Applies:**
  - The client code depends on **abstract factory interfaces**, not concrete implementations.
  - This makes it easy to swap out implementations (e.g., switch from MySQL to PostgreSQL by using a different database factory).

---

### **6. DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)**
- **Principle:** Avoid code duplication.
- **How Abstract Factory Applies:**
  - Instead of duplicating instantiation logic everywhere in the codebase, it is centralized in the factory.
  - This reduces redundancy and **simplifies maintenance**.

---

### **7. Separation of Concerns (SoC)**
- **Principle:** Each part of the system should handle a specific concern.
- **How Abstract Factory Applies:**
  - The factory handles **object creation**.
  - The client handles **business logic**.
  - This clear separation keeps the code modular and easy to manage.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Abstract Factory** pattern aligns with **SOLID principles** by promoting **loose coupling, extensibility, maintainability, and cleaner architecture**. It also embodies **DRY** and **Separation of Concerns**, making it a powerful design choice for complex systems.
