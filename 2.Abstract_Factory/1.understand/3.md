The **Abstract Factory** pattern is categorized as a **Creational** design pattern.  

### Why?  
Because it is all about **how objects are created**. Instead of creating objects directly using `new`, it provides a factory that produces **related objects** while hiding the creation logic.  

ðŸ’¡ **Think of it like a bakery:**  
- You donâ€™t bake bread or cake yourself.  
- You just order from the bakery (factory), and it gives you a ready-made product.  
- The bakery decides how to make it, so you donâ€™t worry about the process.  

Since it focuses on object creation, it's a **Creational** pattern. ðŸ˜Š


The Abstract Factory pattern is categorized as a creational pattern because it focuses on creating objects without specifying their concrete classes, promoting flexibility and scalability in object creation.


## 3.	Is this pattern categorized as creational, structural, or behavioral? Why?

The **Abstract Factory** pattern is categorized as a **Creational Design Pattern**.

### **Why is it a Creational Pattern?**
- **Focuses on Object Creation** â†’ Abstract Factory provides a structured way to create related objects without exposing their instantiation logic.
- **Encapsulates the Construction Logic** â†’ It hides the complexity of creating object families and provides a clean interface for clients.
- **Encourages Dependency Injection** â†’ By abstracting object creation, it promotes loose coupling and flexibility in how objects are instantiated and managed.

### **Comparison with Other Design Pattern Categories**
| **Category**   | **Reason Abstract Factory Doesnâ€™t Fit** |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Structural** | Structural patterns deal with class composition and relationships (e.g., Adapter, Bridge, Composite). Abstract Factory does not focus on structuring objects but on creating them. |
| **Behavioral** | Behavioral patterns define object communication and responsibilities (e.g., Strategy, Observer). Abstract Factory does not control object behavior but rather how objects are instantiated. |
| **Creational** | âœ… Abstract Factory manages object creation, making it a creational pattern like Factory Method, Builder, and Singleton. |

### **Conclusion**
**Abstract Factory is a creational pattern** because it **abstracts object instantiation** and ensures that groups of related objects are created in a consistent and flexible manner. ðŸš€
