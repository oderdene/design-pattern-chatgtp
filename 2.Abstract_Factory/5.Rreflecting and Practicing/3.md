## 23. What is a small project or exercise I can build to practice the abstract factory design pattern?

### **🛠 Small Project to Practice Abstract Factory Design Pattern**
A great way to practice the **Abstract Factory** design pattern is by building a **Cross-Platform Notification System**.

📌 **Project Idea:**  
- Create a system that supports **multiple notification types** (Email, SMS, Push).  
- Allow notifications to be sent using **different providers** (Twilio, AWS SNS, Firebase).  
- Use **Abstract Factory** to dynamically create the correct notification provider.  

---

## **🎯 Project Features**
✅ Supports **multiple notification types** (Email, SMS, Push).  
✅ Supports **multiple providers** (AWS, Twilio, Firebase).  
✅ Uses **Abstract Factory** to create providers dynamically.  
✅ Allows **future extensions** (e.g., adding **WhatsApp notifications** without modifying existing code).  

---

## **🔄 Step 1: Define Product Interfaces**
First, define the **abstract product interfaces**.

📌 **Notification Interface**
```java
interface Notification {
    void send(String message);
}
```
📌 **Notification Factory Interface**
```java
interface NotificationFactory {
    Notification createNotification();
}
```
---

## **🔨 Step 2: Create Concrete Products (Notification Implementations)**
Each **notification type** has multiple **providers**.

📌 **Email Notification Implementations**
```java
class AWSEmailNotification implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending AWS Email: " + message);
    }
}

class TwilioEmailNotification implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending Twilio Email: " + message);
    }
}
```

📌 **SMS Notification Implementations**
```java
class AWSSMSNotification implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending AWS SMS: " + message);
    }
}

class TwilioSMSNotification implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending Twilio SMS: " + message);
    }
}
```

📌 **Push Notification Implementations**
```java
class FirebasePushNotification implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending Firebase Push Notification: " + message);
    }
}
```

---

## **🏭 Step 3: Create Concrete Factories**
Each **factory produces a set of related notifications**.

📌 **AWS Notification Factory**
```java
class AWSNotificationFactory implements NotificationFactory {
    public Notification createNotification() {
        return new AWSEmailNotification();
    }
}
```

📌 **Twilio Notification Factory**
```java
class TwilioNotificationFactory implements NotificationFactory {
    public Notification createNotification() {
        return new TwilioSMSNotification();
    }
}
```

📌 **Firebase Notification Factory**
```java
class FirebaseNotificationFactory implements NotificationFactory {
    public Notification createNotification() {
        return new FirebasePushNotification();
    }
}
```

---

## **🛠 Step 4: Create Factory Selector**
To dynamically **select the correct factory at runtime**.

📌 **Factory Selector**
```java
class NotificationFactorySelector {
    public static NotificationFactory getFactory(String provider) {
        switch (provider.toLowerCase()) {
            case "aws": return new AWSNotificationFactory();
            case "twilio": return new TwilioNotificationFactory();
            case "firebase": return new FirebaseNotificationFactory();
            default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown provider: " + provider);
        }
    }
}
```

---

## **🚀 Step 5: Use the Abstract Factory in a Client Application**
Now, the client can **dynamically select a provider** and **send notifications**.

📌 **Client Code**
```java
public class NotificationApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Select the notification provider dynamically
        NotificationFactory factory = NotificationFactorySelector.getFactory("aws");

        // Create and send notification
        Notification notification = factory.createNotification();
        notification.send("Hello, this is a test notification!");
    }
}
```

📌 **Output**
```
Sending AWS Email: Hello, this is a test notification!
```

---

## **✅ What You Will Learn**
✔ **How to structure an Abstract Factory pattern correctly**.  
✔ **How to create families of related objects** dynamically.  
✔ **How to make your code easily extendable** (adding a new notification provider or type is easy!).  
✔ **How to remove `if-else` statements** by encapsulating object creation.  

---

## **🔥 Bonus: Extend the Project**
🔹 Add **WhatsApp or Telegram notifications**.  
🔹 Add **multiple notification types per factory**.  
🔹 Allow **user input to select notification type dynamically**.
