Libraries like logging in Python and frameworks like Spring (for beans by default) use the singleton pattern.

## 10. What libraries or frameworks already use the singleton design pattern?

Great question! The **Singleton pattern** is widely used behind the scenes in many popular **libraries and frameworks** â€” especially for managing resources that should only exist once (like configuration, logging, database connections, etc.).

Hereâ€™s a list of notable **libraries/frameworks** that use the Singleton pattern:

---

## ðŸ”¥ **Python Libraries & Frameworks**

### 1. **`logging` module (standard library)**

- **How it uses Singleton:**  
  The root logger is essentially a singleton â€” you get the same logger instance every time you call `getLogger(name)` with the same name.

```python
import logging

logger1 = logging.getLogger("app")
logger2 = logging.getLogger("app")

print(logger1 is logger2)  # True
```

---

### 2. **`sqlite3` (Python DB-API)**

- **How it uses Singleton (optionally):**  
  You can create a single connection and reuse it everywhere â€” recommended for apps needing a shared in-memory database or resource.

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')  # singleton-style for session
```

---

### 3. **`Django`**

- **Singleton Examples:**
  - **Settings object** (`from django.conf import settings`) â€“ Singleton object that holds project-level configuration.
  - **Database connections** â€“ Django manages a pool of DB connections internally and treats some as shared singletons.

---

### 4. **`Flask`**

- **App and config objects can act like singletons**:
  - `Flask.current_app` and `Flask.g` give you a globally accessible app context.
  - Extensions often use singletons under the hood (e.g., `Flask-Mail`, `Flask-Login`).

---

## ðŸ§± **Other Frameworks (Outside Python)**

### 5. **Spring Framework (Java)**

- By default, **Spring Beans** are singletons â€” only one instance is created and injected wherever needed.

```java
@Bean
public MyService myService() {
    return new MyService();  // Singleton by default
}
```

---

### 6. **.NET Core (C#)**

- Uses **Dependency Injection** to register services as Singletons:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
```

---

### 7. **Angular (TypeScript)**

- Services provided in the root module (`providedIn: 'root'`) are **Singletons** by default.

```ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class AuthService {}
```

---

### 8. **TensorFlow / PyTorch**

- Session managers, device managers, or logging utilities often follow singleton patterns to manage resources like GPUs or computation graphs efficiently.

## ðŸ§  Why Libraries Use Singleton Pattern:

| Use Case                   | Singleton Role                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Logging                    | Central logger instance shared across app           |
| Config/Settings            | Global settings accessed from anywhere              |
| Database Connections       | Avoid duplicate costly connections                  |
| App Context (Flask/Django) | Shared state like request, user session, app config |
| Resource Managers (GPU)    | Control access to unique system-level resources     |

Let me know if you'd like to explore how one of these works under the hood or want to build your own singleton version of something like Flask's `current_app`!
