The key components are a private constructor, a static instance variable, and a public static method to access the instance.

## 6. What are the key components of the singleton design pattern?

Great! Here are the **key components** of the **Singleton Design Pattern**, along with a clean **Python example** to illustrate them:

---

## üîë **Key Components of the Singleton Pattern:**

1. **Private Constructor / Controlled Instantiation**
   - Prevent direct instantiation of the class using the constructor.
2. **Static Instance Variable**
   - A class-level variable that holds the single instance.
3. **Public Access Method (usually static or class method)**

   - Provides a global access point to get the instance.

4. **Lazy Initialization (optional)**
   - Creates the instance only when it‚Äôs first needed (on-demand).

## üêç **Python Singleton Example (using `__new__`):**

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None  # Static variable to hold the one and only instance

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            # Create and store the instance if it doesn't exist
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def __init__(self):
        print("Initializing Singleton")

# Test
a = Singleton()
b = Singleton()

print(a is b)  # True ‚Äì both point to the same instance
```

### üîç Explanation of Components in Code:

| Component             | Description                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Singleton._instance` | Static variable to store the instance                                                   |
| `__new__` method      | Controls instantiation; ensures only one object is created                              |
| `__init__` method     | Initializes the instance (called each time, but `__new__` ensures it's the same object) |
| `a is b`              | Confirms that both variables reference the same instance                                |

## ‚úÖ Optional: More Pythonic Version Using a Decorator

```python
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

@singleton
class ConfigManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.settings = {}

# Test
config1 = ConfigManager()
config2 = ConfigManager()

print(config1 is config2)  # True
```

This approach is super clean and reusable across multiple classes. Let me know if you want to see a thread-safe version too!
