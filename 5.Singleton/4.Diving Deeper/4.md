As requirements grow, singletons can become inflexible, leading to tight coupling, global state issues, and difficulty adapting to modular designs.

## 19. How does the singleton design pattern evolve with changes in requirements?

Awesome question â€” the **Singleton design pattern** is simple at first, but as **requirements change**, it often has to evolve or be adapted to fit new needs.

Hereâ€™s how Singleton typically **evolves with increasing complexity**, and what to watch out for:

---

## ðŸ”„ **1. From Simple to Lazy Initialization**

### Initial requirement:

> "We just need one instance of a class."

```python
class SimpleSingleton:
    instance = SimpleSingleton()  # created eagerly
```

### Evolved requirement:

> "Create it only when needed."

```python
class LazySingleton:
    _instance = None

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = cls()
        return cls._instance
```

âœ… **Lazy initialization saves memory/resources** for expensive objects.

---

## ðŸ”„ **2. Thread Safety Becomes Necessary**

### New requirement:

> "Our app is now multi-threaded."

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeSingleton:
    _instance = None
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls._instance is None:
                cls._instance = cls()
        return cls._instance
```

âœ… Adds synchronization to prevent multiple instances being created in parallel.

---

## ðŸ”„ **3. You Need Resettable or Replaceable Singletons (for Testing or Reloading)**

### New requirement:

> "We need to reset it for unit testing or reload config at runtime."

```python
class ResettableSingleton:
    _instance = None

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = cls()
        return cls._instance

    @classmethod
    def reset_instance(cls):
        cls._instance = None
```

âœ… Helps with test isolation and flexible reloading.

---

## ðŸ”„ **4. Singleton Starts Needing Variants (Multiton Pattern)**

### New requirement:

> "We now need a separate instance for each user or tenant."

- Evolve to a **Multiton**: A Singleton _per key_ (e.g., per user ID or tenant name).

```python
class Multiton:
    _instances = {}

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls, key):
        if key not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[key] = cls()
        return cls._instances[key]
```

âœ… Solves "singleton-per-scope" without breaking encapsulation.

---

## ðŸ”„ **5. Singleton Needs to Be Replaced with Dependency Injection**

### New requirement:

> "We want cleaner architecture, testability, and runtime configurability."

- Singleton evolves into being managed by a **Dependency Injection (DI) container**.

```python
# Pseudo-code (in a DI framework)
container.register_singleton(Logger)
```

âœ… The framework enforces a single instance **without hardcoding** the singleton logic.

## ðŸ§  Summary: How Singleton Evolves Over Time

| Stage                          | Triggered By                      | Pattern Evolution                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Eager Singleton                | Simple "only one instance" need   | Basic Singleton                        |
| Lazy Singleton                 | Performance/memory considerations | Lazy Initialization                    |
| Thread-Safe Singleton          | Multi-threaded access             | Add locks or use double-check locking  |
| Resettable Singleton           | Testing or runtime reloading      | Add reset functionality                |
| Multiton                       | Scoped singletons per key/context | Keyed instance registry                |
| Dependency Injection Singleton | Complex architecture, testability | Delegate instance control to DI system |

## ðŸš¨ Gotchas to Watch For

- Singleton might **start simple but become bloated** as responsibilities grow.
- Adding too much logic or shared state turns Singleton into a **God Object** (anti-pattern).
- As soon as testability, modularity, or lifecycle control matter â€” consider **refactoring** it.

Want help evolving a Singleton you already have to make it more flexible or testable? I can walk you through a clean refactor.
