Common pitfalls include making code hard to test, introducing hidden dependencies, and accidentally allowing multiple instances in multithreaded code.

## 20. What are the most common pitfalls when using the singleton design pattern?

Great question — while the **Singleton pattern** can be useful, it’s easy to **misuse** or **overuse** it. Below are the **most common pitfalls** developers run into when using Singleton, along with how to avoid them:

---

## ⚠️ **1. Global State Abuse**

> **Problem:** Singleton acts like a global variable.

- Makes code unpredictable and hard to debug.
- Changes in one place can silently affect behavior elsewhere.

🔧 **Tip:** Avoid storing mutable global state inside the singleton unless it’s tightly controlled.

---

## ⚠️ **2. Tight Coupling to the Singleton**

> **Problem:** Classes that use the Singleton are tightly bound to it.

- Hard to swap out or replace the singleton for testing or refactoring.
- Violates the **Dependency Inversion Principle**.

🔧 **Tip:** Use dependency injection or abstract interfaces where possible.

---

## ⚠️ **3. Difficult Unit Testing**

> **Problem:** Singleton state leaks between tests.

- Shared state across tests causes flaky or inconsistent test results.
- Hard to mock or reset a Singleton without special logic.

🔧 **Tip:** Add a `reset_instance()` method for testing, or mock it via DI (dependency injection).

---

## ⚠️ **4. Poor Thread-Safety**

> **Problem:** Race conditions during instance creation in multi-threaded environments.

- Without proper locking, multiple instances may be created.

🔧 **Tip:** Use `threading.Lock()` or implement **double-checked locking** for lazy-loaded singletons.

---

## ⚠️ **5. Overuse of Singleton Pattern**

> **Problem:** Making everything a Singleton “just in case.”

- Leads to inflexible design.
- Encourages anti-patterns like **God Objects** (classes that do too much).

🔧 **Tip:** Use Singleton **only when there’s a logical, real-world need for a single instance** (e.g., config, logger, DB connection).

---

## ⚠️ **6. Hardcoded Access**

> **Problem:** Calling `Singleton.get_instance()` everywhere makes refactoring hard.

- You can’t easily swap implementations or test alternatives.

🔧 **Tip:** Inject the singleton as a dependency instead of hardcoding access.

---

## ⚠️ **7. Lifetime Management Issues**

> **Problem:** Singleton lives for the entire app lifecycle — even if it's no longer needed.

- May cause memory leaks or hold resources longer than necessary.

🔧 **Tip:** If resources (e.g., sockets, files) are used, implement cleanup methods.

---

## ⚠️ **8. Violation of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

> **Problem:** Singleton ends up managing both business logic _and_ its own instance lifecycle.

- Becomes harder to maintain, test, or extend.

🔧 **Tip:** Separate instance management from core responsibilities if complexity grows.

| Thread-unsafe access            | Race conditions and multiple instances | Use locking or thread-safe lazy init |
| Overuse of singleton            | Inflexible, bloated architecture       | Use only when truly needed           |
| Hardcoded access                | Difficult to replace or test           | Inject dependencies                  |
