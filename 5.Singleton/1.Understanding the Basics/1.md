### Why does the singleton design pattern exists?

The singleton design pattern exists to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

### Advantages and disadvantages compared to another pattern?

The singleton pattern simplifies access to a single instance but can make code harder to test and tightly coupled compared to dependency injection.

## 1. What problem does the singleton design pattern solve?

The singleton design pattern solves the problem of controlling object creation by ensuring only one instance of a class exists.

The **Singleton design pattern** addresses two main problems:

### 1. **Ensuring a single instance of a class:**

- **Problem:** Some classes should only have one instance throughout the lifetime of an application. Creating multiple instances can lead to unexpected behaviors, inconsistencies, or resource wastage.
- **Solution:** Singleton pattern restricts instantiation of a class to a single object, ensuring there's exactly one global point of access.

### 2. **Providing global access to an instance:**

- **Problem:** Often, various parts of an application need to share or coordinate through a common resource (e.g., configuration manager, logging system, thread pool, or database connection pool). Passing objects explicitly can be cumbersome or impractical.
- **Solution:** The Singleton pattern provides a global access point to the instance, simplifying interactions between components that need to share resources or state.

### **Benefits:**

- Controls and limits instance creation.
- Facilitates global access without polluting global namespace.
- Ensures consistent state across an application.

### **Common Use Cases:**

- Configuration managers
- Logging services
- Database connection pools
- Caching services
- Thread pools

---

### **Cautions:**

- Singletons can introduce global state, which may complicate testing and maintainability.
- Overuse may lead to tight coupling and difficulty managing dependencies.

Thus, use the Singleton pattern judiciously, considering the trade-offs between convenience and maintainability.
