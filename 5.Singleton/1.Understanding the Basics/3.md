**Correction:**  
"Is the singleton design pattern categorized as creational, structural, or behavioral? Why?"

**Answer:**  
The singleton pattern is categorized as a creational pattern because it controls how and when an object is created.

## 3. Is the singleton design pattern categorized as creational, structural, or behavioral? Why?

The **Singleton design pattern** is categorized as a **creational** design pattern.

---

### **Reasoning:**

- **Creational design patterns** deal explicitly with **object creation mechanisms**. They simplify and control how and when objects are instantiated.

- The Singleton pattern specifically:

  - **Controls object instantiation**: It restricts a class to create only one instance.
  - **Provides a single global point of access**: Ensures one consistent instance throughout the application lifecycle.

- It does **not** deal directly with object composition or organization (structural patterns), nor with communication or interaction between objects (behavioral patterns).

### **Why not Structural or Behavioral?**

| Pattern Category | Focus                                 | Singleton's fit?                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Creational**   | Object creation mechanisms            | ✅ Yes, restricts object creation.  |
| **Structural**   | Object composition and relationships  | ❌ No, doesn’t handle composition.  |
| **Behavioral**   | Object communication and interactions | ❌ No, doesn’t handle interactions. |

---

### **Conclusion:**

Singleton is categorized as a **creational pattern** because its main purpose is to manage and limit object instantiation to a single unique instance.
