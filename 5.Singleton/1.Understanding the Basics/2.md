The primary intent of the singleton design pattern is to restrict instantiation of a class to a single object and provide global access to it.

## 2. What is the primary intent of the singleton design pattern?

The **primary intent** of the **Singleton design pattern** is:

> **To ensure that a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to that instance.**

In other words, Singleton guarantees exactly **one object instance** for the class during the entire lifetime of an application, and makes it **universally accessible** throughout the application.

This intent addresses the needs for controlled access to shared resources (such as configuration settings, logging, or database connections), preventing the overhead or potential errors from creating multiple instances of an object designed to be singular.
