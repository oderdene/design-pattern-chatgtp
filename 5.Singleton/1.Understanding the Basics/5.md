The singleton pattern embodies the principles of controlled access to a sole instance and lazy initialization.

## 5. Which programming principles does the singleton design pattern embody?

The Singleton design pattern embodies several fundamental programming principles:

---

## 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

> _"A class should have only one reason to change."_

- A Singleton class typically has one clear and well-defined responsibility, such as providing controlled access to a shared resource.
- **Example:** A Singleton "Logger" class that only logs messages, having a clearly-defined, singular responsibility.

---

## 2. **Encapsulation**

> _"Objects should manage their own internal state, hiding it from external access."_

- Singleton encapsulates its instance creation logic, hiding the instantiation mechanism.
- Users access the instance through a well-defined interface (like a static method), without knowing the internal instantiation process.
- **Example:** Users calling `Logger.getInstance()` without knowing how the Logger is created or maintained internally.

---

## 3. **Controlled Access**

- Singleton explicitly controls how the instance is created and accessed.
- It prevents arbitrary creation and ensures consistent access.
- **Example:** Ensuring there is exactly one database connection by restricting creation through a global access point.

---

## 4. **Lazy Initialization (optional)**

- Singleton can delay the instance creation until it's actually needed, optimizing resource use.
- **Example:** Instantiating a configuration object only when it's accessed for the first time.

---

## 5. **Global Accessibility**

- Singletons provide a global access point to a single instance.
- This reduces the complexity and overhead associated with repeatedly passing an object reference.
- **Example:** Providing a globally accessible configuration manager for application-wide settings.

## **Summary of Principles Embodied:**

| Principle                            | Explanation                                         | Singleton Example                              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Responsibility Principle**  | Single clear responsibility                         | Logger, ConfigManager                          |
| **Encapsulation**                    | Hiding instance-creation logic from users           | Private constructors, static accessor          |
| **Controlled Access**                | Explicitly managing instance creation and access    | Static method (e.g., `getInstance()`)          |
| **Lazy Initialization** _(optional)_ | Creating instance when it's actually required       | Instance created on first `getInstance()` call |
| **Global Accessibility**             | Instance globally accessible throughout application | Centralized Configurations, Logger             |

Thus, the Singleton pattern primarily embodies the principles of **encapsulation**, **controlled access**, and often adheres closely to the **Single Responsibility Principle** while optionally using lazy initialization and providing a global access point.
