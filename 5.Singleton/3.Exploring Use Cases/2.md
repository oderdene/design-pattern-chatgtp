You should not use it when it causes tight coupling, hinders testing, or breaks object-oriented principles like dependency inversion.

## 12. When should I not use the singleton design pattern?

Awesome ‚Äî knowing **when _not_** to use the Singleton design pattern is just as important as knowing when to use it. While it's convenient, Singleton has **drawbacks** that can cause trouble in certain situations.

---

## üö´ **When NOT to Use the Singleton Pattern**

### 1. **When You Need Flexibility or Extensibility**

- **Problem:** Singleton tightly couples the class to its instance, making it hard to subclass, override, or swap out for another implementation.
- ‚ùå **Avoid Singleton** when you might need different versions of the class (e.g., for testing, plugins, or alternate strategies).

---

### 2. **When You Want to Write Unit Tests Easily**

- **Problem:** Singletons act like global state ‚Äî they can **introduce hidden dependencies** and **state leakage between tests**.
- ‚ùå Singleton makes mocking or resetting state between tests harder.

> **Better alternative:** Use dependency injection to pass in the object explicitly.

---

### 3. **When You Want Loose Coupling**

- **Problem:** Singleton introduces **tight coupling** ‚Äî classes that use the singleton are hardwired to it.
- ‚ùå Makes it harder to swap out or reuse components in isolation.

---

### 4. **In Multi-threaded Environments (Without Care)**

- **Problem:** If implemented poorly, Singletons can be **not thread-safe**, leading to **race conditions** or **multiple instances**.
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt use Singleton without ensuring proper thread safety (e.g., using locks or thread-safe patterns).

---

### 5. **When Global State Is Risky**

- **Problem:** Global state can lead to unpredictable bugs, especially in large apps or apps with concurrent users (like web servers).
- ‚ùå Avoid Singleton when isolation and determinism are critical (e.g., request-based services, functional programming).

---

### 6. **When Using Frameworks That Manage Instances**

- **Problem:** Frameworks like Django, Flask, Angular, and Spring already manage lifecycles and service scopes.
- ‚ùå Avoid Singleton when the framework provides better lifecycle control through dependency injection or service scopes.

---

### 7. **When You Want to Avoid Hidden Dependencies**

- **Problem:** Singleton hides its presence ‚Äî you don‚Äôt pass it in, you just ‚Äúget it,‚Äù which makes code harder to understand and maintain.

## üß† Summary: Avoid Singleton If...

| Situation                              | Why Singleton is a Problem      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Unit testing                           | Hard to isolate and mock        |
| Dependency injection architecture      | Violates inversion of control   |
| Need for multiple instances            | Singleton restricts flexibility |
| Multi-threading (without care)         | Can cause race conditions       |
| Framework handles lifecycle            | Singleton adds redundancy       |
| Clean, maintainable code is a priority | Singleton hides dependencies    |

---

## ‚úÖ Better Alternatives (in some cases):

- **Dependency Injection**
- **Service Locator (with caution)**
- **Modules (for config/logging)**
- **Factory patterns (when flexible instantiation is needed)**
