Yes, singleton can be combined with patterns like factory, facade, or builder to manage shared resources or central coordination.

## 15. Can the singleton design pattern be combined with others for complex solutions?

Absolutely â€” the **Singleton design pattern** can be (and often is) **combined with other design patterns** to create more powerful, flexible, and maintainable architectures. In real-world software, it's rare for patterns to live in isolation.

## ðŸ”— **Common Pattern Combinations with Singleton**

---

### 1. **Singleton + Factory Pattern**

#### âœ… Use Case:

You want a single manager (singleton) that **creates and manages instances** of other classes using a factory method.

#### ðŸ”§ Example:

```python
class ShapeFactory:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def create_shape(self, shape_type):
        if shape_type == "circle":
            return Circle()
        elif shape_type == "square":
            return Square()

factory = ShapeFactory()
circle = factory.create_shape("circle")
```

#### ðŸ§  Why Combine?

- Singleton controls global access.
- Factory encapsulates object creation logic.

---

### 2. **Singleton + Facade Pattern**

#### âœ… Use Case:

You want a **simplified interface (facade)** to complex subsystems, and that facade should be globally accessible.

#### ðŸ§  Why Combine?

- Singleton ensures only one unified interface.
- Facade provides a clean abstraction over multiple systems.

#### ðŸ’¡ Real-World Example:

- A `NotificationManager` singleton that internally handles Email, SMS, and Push services using a facade interface.

---

### 3. **Singleton + Observer Pattern**

#### âœ… Use Case:

A single subject (singleton) needs to **notify multiple observers** about state changes.

#### ðŸ”§ Example:

A `ConfigManager` singleton that allows parts of the app to subscribe and react to configuration changes.

```python
class ConfigManager:
    _instance = None
    _observers = []

    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.config = {}
        return cls._instance

    def set(self, key, value):
        self.config[key] = value
        for obs in self._observers:
            obs.update(key, value)

    def subscribe(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)
```

#### ðŸ§  Why Combine?

- Singleton gives one source of truth.
- Observer adds dynamic, reactive behavior.

---

### 4. **Singleton + Strategy Pattern**

#### âœ… Use Case:

You want a **single context (singleton)** that can switch between **different strategies at runtime**.

#### ðŸ’¡ Real-World Example:

- A singleton `PaymentProcessor` that uses different strategies for credit card, PayPal, or crypto.

---

### 5. **Singleton + Command Pattern**

#### âœ… Use Case:

A singleton command dispatcher receives and executes commands from multiple sources.

#### ðŸ’¡ Real-World Example:

- In game engines, a singleton `InputManager` might queue and execute input commands.

---

### âœ… Summary Table

| Pattern Combination  | Purpose                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Singleton + Factory  | Global creator of objects                       |
| Singleton + Facade   | Global access to simplified subsystem interface |
| Singleton + Observer | Shared subject that notifies many observers     |
| Singleton + Strategy | One context, switchable behavior at runtime     |
| Singleton + Command  | Global command executor/dispatcher              |

---

## ðŸ§  Key Benefits of Combining Patterns:

- Solve more nuanced, real-world problems
- Improve modularity and scalability
- Separate responsibilities while maintaining shared access where needed
