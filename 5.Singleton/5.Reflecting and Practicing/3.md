You can build a logging system, configuration manager, or a simple database connection handler as a small singleton practice project.

## 23. What is a small project or exercise I can build to practice the singleton design pattern?

Great idea! Practicing the **Singleton pattern** with a focused mini-project is a great way to solidify your understanding. Here's a small but practical exercise that's both **fun** and **realistic**:

---

## üß™ **Project: Build a Logger Service with Singleton Pattern**

### üìå **Goal:**

Create a `Logger` class that can:

- Be used from anywhere in your app
- Write logs to a file or console
- Always return the same instance (singleton)

---

## ‚úÖ Features to Implement:

1. **Singleton behavior** (one instance only)
2. **Logging method** (`log(message)`)
3. **Timestamps for each log**
4. **Log to console or optionally to a file**
5. Optional: Allow log level filtering (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)

---

## üß± Suggested Structure:

```python
# logger.py
import time

class Logger:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, logfile=None):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
            cls._instance._logfile = logfile
        return cls._instance

    def log(self, message):
        timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        entry = f"[{timestamp}] {message}"
        print(entry)

        if self._logfile:
            with open(self._logfile, "a") as f:
                f.write(entry + "\n")
```

---

### üìÅ Use it across multiple files:

```python
# module_a.py
from logger import Logger

def do_something():
    Logger().log("Module A is running")

# module_b.py
from logger import Logger

def do_something_else():
    Logger().log("Module B is working too")
```

```python
# main.py
from module_a import do_something
from module_b import do_something_else

do_something()
do_something_else()

# Check the logs ‚Äî both should come from the same logger instance!
```

---

## üß† What You‚Äôll Practice:

- Designing and enforcing singleton behavior
- Using `__new__()` or alternative singleton implementations
- Managing shared state
- Using optional features like lazy initialization or file I/O
- Logging format and usability

## üèÜ Bonus Challenges (if you want more):

| Challenge                                      | Skill                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Add `log_level` filtering (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) | Enum and filtering logic         |
| Add thread-safety with `threading.Lock()`      | Concurrency and safety           |
| Add `reset_instance()` for testability         | Singleton lifecycle management   |
| Add a GUI (like Tkinter) that logs actions     | Combining UI + Singleton pattern |

---

Would you like me to turn this into a mini challenge doc or GitHub-style README so you can track your progress? Or want to pair it with another pattern (like Factory + Singleton)?
