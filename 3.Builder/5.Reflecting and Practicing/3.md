You can build a **"Pizza Order System"** where a **PizzaBuilder** allows users to customize their pizza by selecting the size, crust type, toppings, and extra cheese, then builds the final **Pizza** object.






## 23. What is a small project or exercise I can build to practice the builder design pattern?
### **Practice Project: Build a "Pizza Order System" Using the Builder Pattern 🍕**  

A great way to practice the **Builder Design Pattern** is by **building a simple pizza ordering system**. This exercise will help you understand **how to create objects step by step** with different optional choices.

## **📌 What You Will Learn**
✔️ How to create a **flexible and readable object creation process**.  
✔️ How to handle **optional features** in an object.  
✔️ How to **avoid constructor overload problems**.  

---

## **🛠️ Project Overview: What We Will Build?**  
We will create a **PizzaBuilder** that allows customers to order a pizza **step by step**, choosing:  
1️⃣ **Size** (Small, Medium, Large)  
2️⃣ **Crust Type** (Thin, Thick, Stuffed)  
3️⃣ **Toppings** (Cheese, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Olives, etc.)  
4️⃣ **Extra Cheese Option**  
5️⃣ **Make it Vegetarian Option**  

✅ **Goal:** Use the **Builder Pattern** to allow **flexible pizza creation** instead of long constructors.

---

## **📝 Step 1: Create the `Pizza` Class (Immutable)**
We will **make the constructor private** so that pizzas can **only be created through the Builder**.

```java
public class Pizza {
    private final String size;
    private final String crust;
    private final List<String> toppings;
    private final boolean extraCheese;
    private final boolean vegetarian;

    // Private constructor: Only the builder can create Pizza objects
    private Pizza(PizzaBuilder builder) {
        this.size = builder.size;
        this.crust = builder.crust;
        this.toppings = builder.toppings;
        this.extraCheese = builder.extraCheese;
        this.vegetarian = builder.vegetarian;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Pizza [Size: " + size + ", Crust: " + crust + 
               ", Toppings: " + toppings + 
               ", Extra Cheese: " + extraCheese + 
               ", Vegetarian: " + vegetarian + "]";
    }

    // Public method to access the Builder
    public static PizzaBuilder builder() {
        return new PizzaBuilder();
    }
}
```

---

## **📝 Step 2: Create the `PizzaBuilder` Class 🏗️**
The **builder class** will allow users to **customize their pizza step by step**.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class PizzaBuilder {
    String size;
    String crust;
    List<String> toppings = new ArrayList<>();
    boolean extraCheese;
    boolean vegetarian;

    public PizzaBuilder setSize(String size) {
        this.size = size;
        return this;
    }

    public PizzaBuilder setCrust(String crust) {
        this.crust = crust;
        return this;
    }

    public PizzaBuilder addTopping(String topping) {
        this.toppings.add(topping);
        return this;
    }

    public PizzaBuilder addExtraCheese() {
        this.extraCheese = true;
        return this;
    }

    public PizzaBuilder makeVegetarian() {
        this.vegetarian = true;
        return this;
    }

    public Pizza build() {
        return new Pizza(this);
    }
}
```

## **📝 Step 3: Test the Builder Pattern in the `Main` Class**
Now, let's **build different pizzas** using our **PizzaBuilder** and see the result!

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a customized pizza
        Pizza myPizza = Pizza.builder()
                            .setSize("Large")
                            .setCrust("Stuffed")
                            .addTopping("Pepperoni")
                            .addTopping("Mushrooms")
                            .addExtraCheese()
                            .build();

        // Create a vegetarian pizza
        Pizza vegPizza = Pizza.builder()
                            .setSize("Medium")
                            .setCrust("Thin")
                            .addTopping("Olives")
                            .addTopping("Tomatoes")
                            .makeVegetarian()
                            .build();

        // Print the orders
        System.out.println("Your Order:");
        System.out.println(myPizza);
        System.out.println(vegPizza);
    }
}
```

---

## **🎯 Expected Output**
```
Your Order:
Pizza [Size: Large, Crust: Stuffed, Toppings: [Pepperoni, Mushrooms], Extra Cheese: true, Vegetarian: false]
Pizza [Size: Medium, Crust: Thin, Toppings: [Olives, Tomatoes], Extra Cheese: false, Vegetarian: true]
```

## **🎯 Key Takeaways from This Exercise**
| **Concept** | **What You Learned** |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Builder Pattern** | Step-by-step object creation for flexibility |
| **Avoiding Constructor Overload** | No long constructors with confusing parameters |
| **Handling Optional Fields** | Users can **choose what they need** (like extra cheese) |
| **Making Objects Immutable** | The `Pizza` object is **final and cannot be changed after creation** |
| **Improving Readability** | Code is **clear and self-explanatory** |

## **💡 Extra Challenges (For More Practice!)**
🚀 Want to **push your skills further**? Try these:  
🔹 **Add a "Gluten-Free" Option** to the Builder.  
🔹 **Allow Customization of Pizza Sauce** (e.g., Tomato, BBQ, White Sauce).  
🔹 **Make a PizzaOrder System** that takes multiple orders.
