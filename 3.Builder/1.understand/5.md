The Builder design pattern embodies the following programming principles:  

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** ‚Äì Separates object creation from its representation, ensuring each class has a single responsibility.  

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** ‚Äì Allows extension of object construction steps without modifying existing code.  

3. **Encapsulation** ‚Äì Hides the complex creation logic inside the builder, exposing only necessary steps.  

4. **Fluent Interface Principle** ‚Äì Enables method chaining for a more readable and intuitive object construction process.

The **Builder Design Pattern** follows several important **programming principles** that make code **cleaner, more flexible, and easier to maintain**. Here are the key ones:

---

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ‚úÖ**
   - **Each class should have only one job.**  
   - The **Builder Pattern separates**:
     - The **object‚Äôs creation** (handled by the builder).
     - The **object‚Äôs logic or behavior** (handled by the main class).
   - üîπ **Example:** A **BurgerBuilder** only builds the burger, while the **Burger** class just represents it.

---

### 2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP) üîÑ**
   - **You can extend functionality without modifying existing code.**  
   - The **Builder Pattern allows adding new types of objects** (like different kinds of pizzas, burgers, or houses) **without changing the core building process**.
   - üîπ **Example:** You can create a **VeganBurgerBuilder** without changing the original **BurgerBuilder**.

---

### 3. **Encapsulation üè†**
   - **Hides object complexity** by building it step by step.
   - The user doesn‚Äôt need to know all the details of object creation.
   - üîπ **Example:** Instead of giving users a long constructor (`Burger("Wheat", "Beef", true, false, true...)`), the **Builder provides simple steps** (`builder.setBread("Wheat").setMeat("Beef").build()`).

---

### 4. **Fluent Interface üìñ**
   - The Builder pattern often uses **method chaining**, making the code more readable.
   - üîπ **Example:**  
     ```java
     Burger burger = new BurgerBuilder()
                     .setBread("Sesame")
                     .setMeat("Chicken")
                     .addCheese()
                     .addLettuce()
                     .build();
     ```
   - This makes it **intuitive and easy to use** instead of a huge constructor.

---

### 5. **Separation of Concerns üé≠**
   - The **Builder Pattern keeps object creation separate** from the object itself.
   - üîπ **Example:**  
     - The **Builder** takes care of how the object is built.
     - The **Object (Product)** focuses only on its data and behavior.

---

### **Final Thoughts üöÄ**
The **Builder Pattern** makes code **clean, flexible, and easy to maintain** by following **good programming principles** like **SRP, OCP, Encapsulation, Fluent Interface, and Separation of Concerns**.

## 5. Which programming principles does the builder design pattern embody?
The **Builder Design Pattern** embodies several key programming principles that contribute to clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Here are the main principles it follows:

---

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Principle:** A class should have only one reason to change.
   - **How Builder Follows It:**
     - The **builder class** is responsible only for constructing objects.
     - The **object class** (e.g., `Car`, `House`, `Burger`) is responsible for defining behavior but not its construction.
     - This separation makes code cleaner and more modular.

---

### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - **Principle:** A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **How Builder Follows It:**
     - You can extend the builder to add new configurations **without modifying existing code**.
     - Example: If a `CarBuilder` initially supports **engine and wheels**, you can later add `setColor()` without breaking existing functionality.

---

### **3. Encapsulation**
   - **Principle:** Hide internal object details and expose only necessary construction steps.
   - **How Builder Follows It:**
     - The complex object creation logic is hidden inside the builder.
     - The final object is only exposed after calling `.build()`, preventing incomplete or invalid object states.

---

### **4. Fluent Interface Principle**
   - **Principle:** Improves readability by allowing method chaining.
   - **How Builder Follows It:**
     - Instead of multiple setter methods, the builder provides **chainable methods**.
     - Example:
       ```java
       Car car = new Car.CarBuilder("V8", 4)
                        .setColor("Red")
                        .setSunroof(true)
                        .build();
       ```
     - This results in **cleaner and more expressive** code.

---

### **5. Immutability**
   - **Principle:** Once an object is created, it should not be modified.
   - **How Builder Follows It:**
     - The builder **constructs immutable objects** by setting all values before calling `.build()`.
     - Example: The final `Car` object is immutable because all fields are set in the constructor and no setters exist.

---

### **6. Separation of Concerns**
   - **Principle:** Different parts of the system should handle different concerns.
   - **How Builder Follows It:**
     - The **main class** focuses on business logic.
     - The **builder class** focuses on constructing valid objects.

---

### **7. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - **Principle:** Avoid code duplication.
   - **How Builder Follows It:**
     - Without the builder, multiple constructors (telescoping constructors) would duplicate initialization logic.
     - The builder **centralizes object creation logic**, avoiding redundant constructor overloads.

---

### **Summary Table**
| Principle | How Builder Pattern Embodies It |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| **SRP (Single Responsibility)** | Separates construction logic from object logic |
| **OCP (Open/Closed)** | Allows adding features without modifying existing code |
| **Encapsulation** | Hides object construction details |
| **Fluent Interface** | Enables readable, chainable method calls |
| **Immutability** | Ensures fully constructed objects are immutable |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Distinguishes object creation from usage |
| **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** | Prevents duplicate constructor logic |

By following these principles, the **Builder Pattern** ensures **clean, scalable, and maintainable** object construction in software design. üöÄ
