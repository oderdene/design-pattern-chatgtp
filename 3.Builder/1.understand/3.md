The Builder design pattern is categorized as creational because it focuses on constructing complex objects in a controlled and step-by-step manner.

The **Builder Design Pattern** is categorized as a **Creational Pattern** because its main job is to **help create objects** in a structured and controlled way. 

### Why? ðŸ¤”
- **Creational patterns** focus on **how objects are created**.
- The **Builder Pattern** helps construct **complex objects step by step**, making object creation **more flexible and readable**.
- Instead of **forcing a big, messy constructor** with many parameters, it **guides the process of building an object smoothly**.

Think of it like **assembling a car** ðŸš—:
- First, you **build the frame**.
- Then, you **add the engine**.
- Then, **the seats, doors, and wheels**.
- Finally, you **customize it**.

This **step-by-step creation** process is exactly why the **Builder Pattern** falls under **Creational Patterns**!

## 3. Is the builder design pattern categorized as creational, structural, or behavioral? Why?
The **Builder Design Pattern** is categorized as a **Creational Design Pattern** because its primary purpose is to control and streamline the **object creation process**.

### **Why is it Creational?**
1. **Encapsulates Object Construction**  
   - The builder pattern provides a structured way to create objects, particularly when dealing with complex initialization logic.
   
2. **Separates Construction from Representation**  
   - Unlike direct instantiation (e.g., using constructors), the builder pattern ensures that the construction process is independent of how the object is represented.

3. **Supports Step-by-Step Object Creation**  
   - Instead of providing a single constructor with numerous parameters (telescoping constructors), the builder allows **incremental and flexible object creation**.

### **Comparison with Other Design Pattern Categories**
- **Creational Patterns** focus on how objects are created.
  - Examples: **Builder, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Prototype, Singleton**
  - The builder fits here because it defines a **structured way to create objects**.

- **Structural Patterns** deal with **object composition** and relationships between classes.
  - Examples: **Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Proxy**
  - The builder does not focus on structuring class relationships but rather on constructing objects.

- **Behavioral Patterns** focus on **object interaction and communication**.
  - Examples: **Observer, Strategy, Command, Template Method**
  - The builder does not govern object behavior after instantiation but rather its creation process.

### **Conclusion**
Since the **Builder Pattern** **manages the construction of complex objects** and ensures they are built in a controlled, readable, and flexible manner, it is classified as a **Creational Design Pattern**.
