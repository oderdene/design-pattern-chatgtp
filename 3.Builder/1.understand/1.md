The **Builder design pattern** solves the problem of constructing complex objects step by step while keeping the creation logic separate from the object representation.

The **Builder Design Pattern** solves the problem of **creating complex objects step by step** in a controlled way.

### Simple Example:
Imagine youâ€™re ordering a **custom burger** at a restaurant. Instead of the chef making one giant, messy burger with all possible ingredients, they ask you step by step:

- What type of bread?
- What kind of meat?
- Any cheese?
- Extra toppings?

This step-by-step process ensures that you get exactly what you want without confusion.

### The Problem:
Without the **Builder Pattern**, creating an object with many options (like a burger or a car) might result in **huge, confusing constructors** or **messy code with too many parameters**.

### The Solution:
The **Builder Pattern** provides a **structured way to create an object step by step**, making the code **cleaner and easier to understand**.

## 1. What problem does the builder design pattern solve?

The **Builder Design Pattern** solves the problem of constructing complex objects step by step in a controlled manner while keeping the construction process separate from the actual representation of the object.

### **Problems it Addresses**
1. **Complex Object Creation:** When an object has multiple optional and mandatory attributes, managing its construction through constructors or setters can be cumbersome and error-prone.
2. **Constructor Overloading Issues:** If an object requires different configurations, using multiple constructors (telescoping constructors) can lead to code that is hard to read and maintain.
3. **Immutable Object Creation:** If an object should be immutable, setting properties after instantiation is not an option. The builder pattern provides a way to construct such objects with a clean and readable approach.
4. **Encapsulation of Construction Logic:** The pattern encapsulates the object creation logic, separating it from the object's business logic.
5. **Readability and Maintainability:** By allowing step-by-step object construction, the builder pattern makes code more readable and easier to maintain.

### **Solution Provided by the Builder Pattern**
- **Separates object construction from its representation.**
- **Provides a clear, chainable, and readable API** for object creation.
- **Supports complex configurations** with default values, optional parameters, and variations.
- **Encapsulates the construction logic**, making the main codebase cleaner.
- **Improves testability** by allowing controlled object instantiation.

### **Example:**
#### **Without Builder Pattern (Using Telescoping Constructors)**
```java
public class Car {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;
    private boolean sunroof;

    public Car(String engine, int wheels) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.wheels = wheels;
    }

    public Car(String engine, int wheels, boolean sunroof) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.wheels = wheels;
        this.sunroof = sunroof;
    }
}
```
**Problem:** This approach becomes unmanageable as the number of parameters grows.

#### **With Builder Pattern**
```java
public class Car {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;
    private boolean sunroof;

    private Car(CarBuilder builder) {
        this.engine = builder.engine;
        this.wheels = builder.wheels;
        this.sunroof = builder.sunroof;
    }

    public static class CarBuilder {
        private String engine;
        private int wheels;
        private boolean sunroof;

        public CarBuilder(String engine, int wheels) {
            this.engine = engine;
            this.wheels = wheels;
        }

        public CarBuilder setSunroof(boolean sunroof) {
            this.sunroof = sunroof;
            return this;
        }

        public Car build() {
            return new Car(this);
        }
    }
}
```
**Usage:**
```java
Car car = new Car.CarBuilder("V8", 4).setSunroof(true).build();
```
**Benefits:**
âœ” Avoids multiple constructors  
âœ” Provides a clear step-by-step object creation  
âœ” Encapsulates construction logic  

The **Builder Pattern** is widely used in frameworks and libraries where complex objects need flexible and readable instantiation.
