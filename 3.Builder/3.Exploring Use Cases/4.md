**Correction:** "What is an example of the Builder design pattern in real-world software systems?"  

An example of the Builder design pattern in real-world software systems is **Apache HttpClient**, which uses a builder to configure and create HTTP requests efficiently.



### **Real-World Example of the Builder Design Pattern: Creating SQL Queries in Hibernate (Java ORM) 🏗️**
  
The **Builder Design Pattern** is widely used in **real-world software systems** where complex objects need to be **constructed step by step**. One great example is **Hibernate's Criteria API**, which is used for **building dynamic SQL queries**.

---

### **📌 Scenario: Why is the Builder Pattern Used?**
Imagine you are working on an **e-commerce system**, and you need to **filter products** based on **different optional conditions** (e.g., category, price range, brand, etc.).

- Some users **search by category**.
- Some users **search by price**.
- Some users **search by brand + price**.
- Some users **search with all filters**.

Instead of writing **multiple overloaded query methods**, **Hibernate's Criteria API** uses the **Builder Pattern** to construct SQL queries dynamically.

---

### **🔹 Without Builder Pattern (Messy Code with Multiple Methods)**
You might need many methods for different filter combinations:
```java
List<Product> getProductsByCategory(String category);
List<Product> getProductsByPriceRange(double min, double max);
List<Product> getProductsByBrandAndPrice(String brand, double min, double max);
```
This approach **does not scale well** as the number of filters increases.

---

### **✅ With Builder Pattern (Hibernate Criteria API)**
Hibernate **solves this problem** by using a **Builder Pattern** with `CriteriaBuilder`. Instead of writing **many methods**, you **build queries step by step**:

```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Product> query = cb.createQuery(Product.class);
Root<Product> root = query.from(Product.class);

List<Predicate> predicates = new ArrayList<>();

// Dynamically add filters based on user input
if (category != null) {
    predicates.add(cb.equal(root.get("category"), category));
}
if (minPrice != null && maxPrice != null) {
    predicates.add(cb.between(root.get("price"), minPrice, maxPrice));
}
if (brand != null) {
    predicates.add(cb.equal(root.get("brand"), brand));
}

// Apply all conditions dynamically
query.where(predicates.toArray(new Predicate[0]));

TypedQuery<Product> finalQuery = entityManager.createQuery(query);
List<Product> products = finalQuery.getResultList();
```

### **🎯 Why is This a Great Example of the Builder Pattern?**
| **Feature** | **How Hibernate Uses the Builder Pattern** |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Step-by-step object creation** | Queries are **built dynamically** with optional filters. |
| **Avoids large constructors** | No need to create multiple methods with different parameters. |
| **Improves flexibility** | Users can combine **any filters they want** without modifying the query logic. |
| **Cleaner & scalable code** | New filters can be **added easily** without changing existing code. |

### **🔹 Other Real-World Uses of Builder Pattern**
✔️ **StringBuilder (Java)** → Builds strings efficiently instead of using `+` concatenation.  
✔️ **Document Builders (XML/JSON APIs)** → `DocumentBuilderFactory` builds structured XML documents.  
✔️ **Lombok's `@Builder` Annotation** → Simplifies object creation in Java.  
✔️ **Report Generation Systems** → Step-by-step report creation (adding headers, charts, tables, etc.).

## 14. What is an example of the builder design pattern in real-world software systems?
### **🔹 Real-World Example of the Builder Design Pattern in Software Systems**
The **Builder Design Pattern** is widely used in **real-world software** to create complex objects in a structured and readable way. One prominent example is **Android’s `NotificationCompat.Builder`**, used for constructing **Android notifications**.

---

## **📌 Example: `NotificationCompat.Builder` in Android**
### **🔹 Scenario: Constructing Android Notifications**
In **Android development**, the **Builder Pattern** is used to create **notifications** efficiently. Since a notification contains multiple optional elements (title, text, icon, sound, actions, etc.), a builder provides a **clean way to assemble** them.

### **🔹 How the Builder Pattern is Used**
Android provides the **`NotificationCompat.Builder`** class to create notifications **step-by-step** instead of requiring a long constructor with many parameters.

---

## **🚀 Code Example: Creating an Android Notification with the Builder Pattern**
```java
NotificationCompat.Builder builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)
    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)  // Required: Set the notification icon
    .setContentTitle("New Message")              // Optional: Set the title
    .setContentText("You have a new message.")   // Optional: Set the main text
    .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH)  // Optional: Set priority level
    .setAutoCancel(true);  // Optional: Dismiss the notification when clicked

// Build and display the notification
NotificationManagerCompat notificationManager = NotificationManagerCompat.from(context);
notificationManager.notify(1, builder.build());
```

---

## **📌 Why is the Builder Pattern Used Here?**
| **Problem** | **Solution Using Builder** |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Notifications have **many optional attributes** (title, text, icon, sound, actions, etc.). | The **builder allows setting only required properties**, keeping the API clean. |
| **Using a constructor would require too many parameters**, making the code unreadable. | The builder provides **method chaining**, improving readability. |
| Some attributes **depend on others** (e.g., `setAutoCancel(true)` only makes sense with an action). | The builder **ensures a structured approach** to notification construction. |
| Developers should be able to **easily modify** notifications without changing core logic. | The builder **encapsulates object creation logic**. |

---

## **🔹 Another Real-World Example: Hibernate’s `CriteriaBuilder`**
Another great **real-world use of the Builder Pattern** is in **Hibernate** for constructing **dynamic database queries**.

### **Example: Using `CriteriaBuilder` to Build a Query**
```java
CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Employee> query = cb.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> root = query.from(Employee.class);
query.select(root).where(cb.equal(root.get("department"), "IT"));

List<Employee> employees = entityManager.createQuery(query).getResultList();
```
✔ The **Builder Pattern helps construct flexible and complex queries** in a structured way.

---

## **📌 Summary of Real-World Builder Pattern Uses**
| **Software System** | **Where Builder is Used** | **Why Builder is Useful?** |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Android SDK** | `NotificationCompat.Builder` | Constructs notifications step-by-step. |
| **Hibernate (JPA)** | `CriteriaBuilder` | Builds dynamic database queries. |
| **Spring Framework** | `BeanDefinitionBuilder` | Defines beans dynamically. |
| **Google Guava** | `ImmutableList.Builder` | Creates immutable collections flexibly. |
| **Lombok** | `@Builder` Annotation | Auto-generates builder patterns for Java objects. |

---

## **🚀 Conclusion**
The **Builder Pattern** is widely used in real-world applications where:
- **Object construction is complex and has many optional parameters**.
- **A step-by-step, readable API is needed**.
- **Object immutability or different configurations are required**.

The Android **`NotificationCompat.Builder`** and Hibernate’s **`CriteriaBuilder`** are prime examples where the **Builder Pattern** provides a flexible, readable, and structured approach to constructing objects. 🚀
