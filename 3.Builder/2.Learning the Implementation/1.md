The key components of the Builder design pattern are:  

1. **Builder** ‚Äì An interface or abstract class defining the steps to build a complex object.  

2. **Concrete Builder** ‚Äì Implements the builder interface and provides specific implementations for constructing the object.  

3. **Director** ‚Äì Controls the construction process by calling the builder's methods in a specific sequence.  

4. **Product** ‚Äì The final complex object that is created using the builder.


The **Builder Design Pattern** has **four key components**, each playing an important role in creating complex objects step by step. Here's a simple breakdown:

---

### **1. Product (The Final Object) üéÅ**
   - This is the **thing you‚Äôre building**.
   - It has many parts and options.
   - üîπ **Example:** A **Burger, Car, or Computer**.

---

### **2. Builder (The Construction Plan) üèóÔ∏è**
   - This is the **blueprint** for building the product.
   - It has **methods** to set different parts.
   - üîπ **Example:** A **BurgerBuilder** that lets you add buns, meat, cheese, etc.

---

### **3. Concrete Builder (The Actual Worker) üî®**
   - This is the **real builder** that **implements the blueprint**.
   - It **tracks progress** as the object is built.
   - üîπ **Example:** A **VegBurgerBuilder or ChickenBurgerBuilder**.

---

### **4. Director (The Supervisor) üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**
   - **Controls the building process** by deciding what steps to follow.
   - Uses the **Builder** to create an object in a structured way.
   - **Optional**‚Äîyou can skip it if building manually.
   - üîπ **Example:** A **Waiter at a restaurant** who collects your order and tells the chef how to prepare the burger.

---

### **Simple Example: Building a Burger üçî**
Here‚Äôs how these components work together:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Product** ‚Üí The **Burger** (final object).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Builder** ‚Üí The **BurgerBuilder** (how to make a burger).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Concrete Builder** ‚Üí **ChickenBurgerBuilder or VegBurgerBuilder** (specific recipe).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Director** ‚Üí **Waiter** (tells the builder what kind of burger to make).  

---

### **Code Example (Java-style)**
```java
// 1. Product (Final Object)
class Burger {
    private String bun;
    private String meat;
    private boolean cheese;
    private boolean lettuce;

    public Burger(String bun, String meat, boolean cheese, boolean lettuce) {
        this.bun = bun;
        this.meat = meat;
        this.cheese = cheese;
        this.lettuce = lettuce;
    }

    public void showBurger() {
        System.out.println("Burger with " + bun + ", " + meat + 
                           (cheese ? ", cheese" : "") + 
                           (lettuce ? ", lettuce" : ""));
    }
}

// 2. Builder (Blueprint)
class BurgerBuilder {
    private String bun;
    private String meat;
    private boolean cheese;
    private boolean lettuce;

    public BurgerBuilder setBun(String bun) {
        this.bun = bun;
        return this;
    }

    public BurgerBuilder setMeat(String meat) {
        this.meat = meat;
        return this;
    }

    public BurgerBuilder addCheese() {
        this.cheese = true;
        return this;
    }

    public BurgerBuilder addLettuce() {
        this.lettuce = true;
        return this;
    }

    public Burger build() {
        return new Burger(bun, meat, cheese, lettuce);
    }
}

// 4. Director (Optional)
class Waiter {
    public Burger makeCheeseBurger(BurgerBuilder builder) {
        return builder.setBun("Sesame")
                      .setMeat("Beef")
                      .addCheese()
                      .build();
    }
}

// Using the Builder Pattern
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build manually
        Burger myBurger = new BurgerBuilder()
                          .setBun("Wheat")
                          .setMeat("Chicken")
                          .addLettuce()
                          .build();
        myBurger.showBurger();

        // Build using Director
        Waiter waiter = new Waiter();
        Burger cheeseBurger = waiter.makeCheeseBurger(new BurgerBuilder());
        cheeseBurger.showBurger();
    }
}
```

### **Output**
```
Burger with Wheat, Chicken, lettuce
Burger with Sesame, Beef, cheese
```

## 6. What are the key components of the builder design pattern?
The **Builder Design Pattern** consists of several key components that work together to create complex objects step by step. Here are the main components:

---

### **1. Product (The Complex Object)**
   - The object that needs to be constructed step by step.
   - It may have multiple optional and mandatory attributes.
   - Example: `Car`, `House`, `Burger`, `Computer`.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   public class Car {
       private String engine;
       private int wheels;
       private boolean sunroof;
       
       public Car(String engine, int wheels, boolean sunroof) {
           this.engine = engine;
           this.wheels = wheels;
           this.sunroof = sunroof;
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **2. Builder (Abstract Builder)**
   - Defines the blueprint (interface or abstract class) for building the product.
   - Contains methods for **setting different parts** of the product.
   - Usually returns `this` (for method chaining).
   - Provides a `build()` method to return the final product.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   public interface CarBuilder {
       CarBuilder setEngine(String engine);
       CarBuilder setWheels(int wheels);
       CarBuilder setSunroof(boolean sunroof);
       Car build();
   }
   ```

---

### **3. Concrete Builder**
   - Implements the **Builder Interface**.
   - Provides the actual implementation for constructing a specific product.
   - Stores intermediate state during object construction.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   public class ConcreteCarBuilder implements CarBuilder {
       private String engine;
       private int wheels;
       private boolean sunroof;

       @Override
       public CarBuilder setEngine(String engine) {
           this.engine = engine;
           return this;
       }

       @Override
       public CarBuilder setWheels(int wheels) {
           this.wheels = wheels;
           return this;
       }

       @Override
       public CarBuilder setSunroof(boolean sunroof) {
           this.sunroof = sunroof;
           return this;
       }

       @Override
       public Car build() {
           return new Car(engine, wheels, sunroof);
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **4. Director (Optional)**
   - **Controls the object creation process**.
   - Calls the builder's methods in a specific order to create a **standardized** product.
   - Useful when **predefined configurations** (e.g., "Sports Car", "Luxury Car") are needed.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   public class CarDirector {
       public Car constructSportsCar(CarBuilder builder) {
           return builder.setEngine("V8")
                         .setWheels(4)
                         .setSunroof(true)
                         .build();
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **5. Client (The User)**
   - Uses the builder to create an object.
   - May use the `Director` or call the builder directly.

   **Example (Using Builder Directly):**
   ```java
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Car car = new ConcreteCarBuilder()
                       .setEngine("V6")
                       .setWheels(4)
                       .setSunroof(true)
                       .build();
           System.out.println("Car built successfully!");
       }
   }
   ```

   **Example (Using Director):**
   ```java
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           CarBuilder builder = new ConcreteCarBuilder();
           CarDirector director = new CarDirector();
           Car sportsCar = director.constructSportsCar(builder);
           System.out.println("Sports Car built successfully!");
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **Summary of Components**
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Product** | The final complex object being built. |
| **Builder (Abstract Builder)** | Defines the steps for constructing the product. |
| **Concrete Builder** | Implements the steps defined by the builder. |
| **Director (Optional)** | Manages the construction sequence and predefined configurations. |
| **Client** | Uses the builder (or director) to construct the object. |

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Builder Pattern** provides **flexibility, separation of concerns, and a fluent API** for constructing complex objects. It eliminates **constructor overloading** issues and makes object instantiation **more readable and maintainable**. üöÄ
