The **structure** of the **Builder Design Pattern** consists of four main components:  

1. **Builder (Abstract Class or Interface)** – Defines the abstract steps for constructing a product.  
2. **Concrete Builder** – Implements the builder interface and defines the specific steps for creating the object.  
3. **Director** – Manages the construction process by invoking the builder's methods in a specific sequence.  
4. **Product** – The final complex object built using the builder.

                |      Product      |
                +------------------+
```
### **Explanation**  
- The **Director** calls the builder methods to construct a **Product** in a specific order.  
- The **Builder** interface defines the steps for building a product.  
- The **Concrete Builder(s)** implement the steps and return the product.  
- The **Product** is the final object created.

### **2. Explanation in Simple Terms**
The **Builder Design Pattern** has four key parts:

1️⃣ **Director 👷‍♂️ (Optional)** → Oversees the building process and tells the builder what to do.  
   🔹 **Example:** A **Waiter** taking burger orders.

2️⃣ **Builder 🏗️ (Blueprint)** → Defines the steps to create a product.  
   🔹 **Example:** A **BurgerBuilder** with methods like `setBun()`, `setMeat()`, `addCheese()`.

3️⃣ **Concrete Builder 🔨** → Implements the builder steps differently.  
   🔹 **Example:**  
   - `VegBurgerBuilder` (creates a vegetarian burger).  
   - `ChickenBurgerBuilder` (creates a chicken burger).

4️⃣ **Product 🎁** → The final object that gets built.  
   🔹 **Example:** The **Burger** itself.

---

### **3. Real-World Example: Building a House 🏡**
- **Director:** A **Project Manager** deciding what kind of house to build.
- **Builder:** A **Blueprint** for building houses.
- **Concrete Builder:**  
  - **BrickHouseBuilder** (builds a brick house).  
  - **WoodHouseBuilder** (builds a wooden house).
- **Product:** The **House**.

### **Explanation of UML Components**
| **Component**        | **Description** |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **Product**         | The complex object being built. |
| **Builder (Abstract Class / Interface)** | Defines the steps for constructing the product. |
| **Concrete Builders** | Implements the builder interface to build different versions of the product. |
| **Director (Optional)** | Manages the construction sequence and predefined configurations. |
| **Client** | Uses the builder (or director) to construct the object. |

### **Example in Java**
```java
// Step 1: Product Class (Complex Object)
class Car {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;
    private boolean sunroof;

    public Car(String engine, int wheels, boolean sunroof) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.wheels = wheels;
        this.sunroof = sunroof;
    }

    public void showCar() {
        System.out.println("Car with Engine: " + engine + ", Wheels: " + wheels + ", Sunroof: " + sunroof);
    }
}

// Step 2: Builder Interface
interface CarBuilder {
    CarBuilder setEngine(String engine);
    CarBuilder setWheels(int wheels);
    CarBuilder setSunroof(boolean sunroof);
    Car build();
}

// Step 3: Concrete Builder
class ConcreteCarBuilder implements CarBuilder {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;
    private boolean sunroof;

    @Override
    public CarBuilder setEngine(String engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
        return this;
    }

    @Override
    public CarBuilder setWheels(int wheels) {
        this.wheels = wheels;
        return this;
    }

    @Override
    public CarBuilder setSunroof(boolean sunroof) {
        this.sunroof = sunroof;
        return this;
    }

    @Override
    public Car build() {
        return new Car(engine, wheels, sunroof);
    }
}

// Step 4: Director (Optional)
class CarDirector {
    public Car constructSportsCar(CarBuilder builder) {
        return builder.setEngine("V8")
                      .setWheels(4)
                      .setSunroof(true)
                      .build();
    }
}

// Step 5: Client Code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarBuilder builder = new ConcreteCarBuilder();
        CarDirector director = new CarDirector();
        
        Car sportsCar = director.constructSportsCar(builder);
        sportsCar.showCar();
    }
}
```
### **Output**
```
Car with Engine: V8, Wheels: 4, Sunroof: true
```

### **Key Takeaways**
- The **Builder Pattern** helps in creating **complex objects step by step**.
- It **separates construction from representation**.
- The **Director (optional)** helps construct objects with **predefined configurations**.
- The **Concrete Builder** ensures different representations of the same object.

The UML structure provides a **clear, structured approach** to implementing the Builder pattern in software design. 🚀
