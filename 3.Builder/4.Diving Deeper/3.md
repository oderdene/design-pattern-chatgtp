In concurrent or multi-threaded environments, the **Builder design pattern** behaves as follows:  

1. **Thread-Safety Concern** ‚Äì A typical builder is **not thread-safe** because multiple threads modifying the same builder instance can cause inconsistent states.  
2. **Safe Usage** ‚Äì To ensure thread safety, use **separate builder instances per thread** or **synchronize access** if shared.  
3. **Immutable Final Object** ‚Äì Once built, the final object is usually immutable, making it **safe for concurrent use**.  
4. **Thread-Safe Implementation** ‚Äì Using **ThreadLocal** builders or making the builder **stateless** can improve thread safety.  

For multi-threaded scenarios, prefer **immutable builders** or use **synchronization mechanisms** to avoid concurrency issues.




### **How Does the Builder Pattern Work in Multi-Threaded Environments? ‚öôÔ∏è**  

The **Builder Design Pattern** can be **both safe and risky** in **multi-threaded environments**, depending on how you use it. Let‚Äôs break it down simply:

---

## **‚úÖ When the Builder Pattern is Safe in Multi-Threading**
The **Builder Pattern is safe** in **multi-threaded environments** **IF**:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Each **thread has its own Builder instance**.  
   - Builders are typically **not shared** between threads.  
   - **Example:** Each thread creates its own `CarBuilder` and then calls `.build()`.

**üîπ Safe Example: Using Builder in Multi-Threading**
```java
Runnable task = () -> {
    Car car = new CarBuilder()
                 .setType("Sedan")
                 .setColor("Blue")
                 .setEngine("V6")
                 .build();
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " built: " + car);
};

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    new Thread(task).start();
}
```
‚úÖ **Each thread has its own Builder, so no conflicts occur.**

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è When the Builder Pattern is NOT Safe in Multi-Threading**
The **Builder Pattern is NOT safe** **IF**:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **The same Builder instance is shared** across multiple threads.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Builder methods modify shared state**, leading to **race conditions**.  

**üîπ Example of Unsafe Shared Builder (BAD)**
```java
CarBuilder sharedBuilder = new CarBuilder();  // Shared across threads

Runnable task = () -> {
    sharedBuilder.setColor("Red");  // Multiple threads modify the same object
    sharedBuilder.setEngine("V8");
    Car car = sharedBuilder.build();
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " built: " + car);
};

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    new Thread(task).start();
}
```
‚ùå **Problem:**  
- Multiple threads **modify the same builder at the same time**, causing **unexpected results**.  
- One thread might **overwrite** another thread‚Äôs changes! üòµ  

---

## **üöÄ How to Make Builder Thread-Safe?**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Best Solution: Use Thread-Local Storage (TLS)**
‚úÖ **Each thread gets its own separate Builder instance** using `ThreadLocal`.  
```java
ThreadLocal<CarBuilder> threadLocalBuilder = ThreadLocal.withInitial(CarBuilder::new);

Runnable task = () -> {
    Car car = threadLocalBuilder.get().setColor("Blue").setEngine("V6").build();
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " built: " + car);
};

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    new Thread(task).start();
}
```
‚úÖ **Each thread gets its own copy of the Builder ‚Üí No interference!** üéØ  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative: Synchronize the Builder (Slower)**
- You can make **Builder methods synchronized**, but this reduces performance.
- **Example:**
```java
public synchronized CarBuilder setColor(String color) { 
    this.color = color; 
    return this; 
}
```
‚ùå **Downside:** Slows down multi-threading by forcing threads to wait for each other.

---

### **üéØ Summary: Is the Builder Pattern Thread-Safe?**
| **Scenario** | **Is It Safe?** | **Solution** |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| **Each thread has its own Builder** | ‚úÖ **Safe** | No changes needed |
| **Builder is shared across threads** | ‚ùå **Not Safe** | Use `ThreadLocal` or create separate instances |
| **Builder methods modify shared state** | ‚ùå **Not Safe** | Synchronize methods (but slows performance) |

---

## **Final Verdict üèÜ**
- **Best Practice:** **Do not share the same Builder instance across threads!** ‚ùå  
- **If necessary:** Use **ThreadLocal** for safe multi-threading ‚úÖ

## 18. How does the builder design pattern behave in concurrent or multi-threaded environments?
### **üöÄ Builder Design Pattern in Concurrent or Multi-Threaded Environments**
The **Builder Design Pattern** is typically **not thread-safe** by default. However, with proper modifications, it can be **adapted** for use in concurrent or multi-threaded environments.

---

## **üîπ Challenges of Using Builder in Multi-Threading**
| **Challenge** | **Why It Happens?** | **Impact** |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Builder is mutable** | The builder class holds an intermediate state, which can be modified by multiple threads. | **Race conditions, inconsistent objects, or corrupted state.** |
| **Multiple threads modifying the same builder** | If multiple threads use the same `Builder` instance, they may overwrite each other‚Äôs data. | **Data corruption and unexpected behavior.** |
| **Lack of synchronization** | Most builders do not use locks or synchronization. | **Leads to unpredictable results when used across threads.** |

---

## **üîπ When is the Builder Pattern Safe in Multi-Threading?**
### **‚úÖ Safe Scenarios**
‚úî If **each thread has its own builder instance**.  
‚úî If the builder is **only used in a single-threaded context**.  
‚úî If the builder **only sets immutable fields** before creating the object.

### **üö´ Unsafe Scenarios**
‚ùå If **multiple threads share a single builder instance**.  
‚ùå If a **shared builder modifies mutable fields** concurrently.  
‚ùå If the **builder method chaining is interrupted by concurrent access**.

---

## **üîπ Approaches to Make Builder Thread-Safe**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Approach: Use Thread-Local Builder Instances**
Each thread gets its own separate builder instance, avoiding conflicts.

```java
public class CarBuilder {
    private static final ThreadLocal<CarBuilder> threadLocalBuilder = ThreadLocal.withInitial(CarBuilder::new);
    
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;
    private String color;

    public static CarBuilder getInstance() {
        return threadLocalBuilder.get();
    }

    public CarBuilder setEngine(String engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
        return this;
    }

    public CarBuilder setWheels(int wheels) {
        this.wheels = wheels;
        return this;
    }

    public CarBuilder setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
        return this;
    }

    public Car build() {
        return new Car(engine, wheels, color);
    }
}
```
**‚úî Ensures each thread gets an isolated `CarBuilder` instance.**  
**‚úî Avoids race conditions by keeping builders separate.**

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Approach: Use a Synchronized Builder**
You can add `synchronized` blocks to ensure that only one thread modifies the builder at a time.

```java
public class CarBuilder {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;
    private String color;

    public synchronized CarBuilder setEngine(String engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
        return this;
    }

    public synchronized CarBuilder setWheels(int wheels) {
        this.wheels = wheels;
        return this;
    }

    public synchronized CarBuilder setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
        return this;
    }

    public synchronized Car build() {
        return new Car(engine, wheels, color);
    }
}
```
**‚úî Thread-safe but slower due to synchronized method calls.**  
**‚úî Suitable when the builder must be shared between threads.**  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Approach: Use Immutable Objects (Functional Builders)**
Instead of modifying the builder in place, return a **new immutable builder instance** for each modification.

```java
public class CarBuilder {
    private final String engine;
    private final int wheels;
    private final String color;

    public CarBuilder() {
        this.engine = "";
        this.wheels = 0;
        this.color = "";
    }

    private CarBuilder(String engine, int wheels, String color) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.wheels = wheels;
        this.color = color;
    }

    public CarBuilder withEngine(String engine) {
        return new CarBuilder(engine, this.wheels, this.color);
    }

    public CarBuilder withWheels(int wheels) {
        return new CarBuilder(this.engine, wheels, this.color);
    }

    public CarBuilder withColor(String color) {
        return new CarBuilder(this.engine, this.wheels, color);
    }

    public Car build() {
        return new Car(engine, wheels, color);
    }
}
```
**‚úî Completely thread-safe because it avoids shared state.**  
**‚úî Each thread works with its own immutable instance.**  
**‚úî Works well with functional programming and streams.**  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Approach: Use Concurrent Collections for Shared State**
If multiple threads need to modify a builder **collaboratively**, use **concurrent collections** like `ConcurrentHashMap`.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class ConcurrentCarBuilder {
    private ConcurrentHashMap<String, Object> attributes = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public ConcurrentCarBuilder setEngine(String engine) {
        attributes.put("engine", engine);
        return this;
    }

    public ConcurrentCarBuilder setWheels(int wheels) {
        attributes.put("wheels", wheels);
        return this;
    }

    public ConcurrentCarBuilder setColor(String color) {
        attributes.put("color", color);
        return this;
    }

    public Car build() {
        return new Car(
            (String) attributes.getOrDefault("engine", "Default Engine"),
            (int) attributes.getOrDefault("wheels", 4),
            (String) attributes.getOrDefault("color", "Black")
        );
    }
}
```
**‚úî Allows multiple threads to work on the same builder safely.**  
**‚úî Useful when a shared builder needs concurrent modifications.**  

---

## **üìå Summary: How to Handle Builder in Multi-Threading?**
| **Approach** | **Thread-Safety** | **Performance Impact** | **Best Use Case** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Thread-Local Builder** | ‚úÖ Safe | üîπ No overhead | Per-thread configurations. |
| **Synchronized Builder** | ‚úÖ Safe | ‚ùå Slower due to locks | Shared builder, but low-performance needs. |
| **Immutable Builder** | ‚úÖ Safe | üîπ Efficient (no locks) | Functional-style coding. |
| **Concurrent Collections** | ‚úÖ Safe | üîπ Moderate overhead | Shared builders needing thread safety. |

---

## **üöÄ Conclusion**
- The **Builder Pattern is NOT thread-safe by default** because it maintains mutable state.  
- In **multi-threaded environments**, **using separate builder instances per thread** is **recommended**.  
- **If sharing is required**, consider:
  - **Thread-local builders** for independent configurations.
  - **Synchronized methods** if a single builder must be shared.
  - **Immutable builders** for a purely functional approach.
  - **Concurrent collections** for shared state modification.

üëâ **Rule of Thumb:** If your application is **multi-threaded**, ensure **each thread gets its own builder** or use **immutable or synchronized approaches** for thread safety. üöÄ
