The **Builder design pattern** evolves well with changing requirements because:  

1. **Extensible** – New fields or methods can be added to the builder without modifying existing object construction logic.  
2. **Backward Compatibility** – Existing builder methods remain intact, allowing gradual enhancements without breaking existing code.  
3. **Optional Parameters Support** – New optional features can be added without affecting object creation for existing clients.  
4. **Separation of Concerns** – The construction logic remains separate from the object itself, making updates easier.  

This flexibility makes the **Builder pattern ideal for evolving, complex objects** where additional configurations may be introduced over time.




### **How Does the Builder Design Pattern Evolve with Changing Requirements? 🔄**  

The **Builder Pattern** is designed to be **flexible**, making it **easy to adapt when requirements change**. Let’s see how it handles new requirements **without breaking old code**.

---

## **1️⃣ Adding New Optional Features (Easy ✅)**  
🔹 **Scenario:** A company sells **cars**, and originally, the **CarBuilder** only had `color` and `engine`.  
🔹 **New Requirement:** Customers now want **a sunroof option**.

### **🔍 Without Builder (Constructor Overload Hell) ❌**  
Each new feature requires **adding more constructors**:
```java
// Old constructor
Car(String color, String engine) { ... }

// New constructor (adds sunroof)
Car(String color, String engine, boolean sunroof) { ... }

// Future: If we add GPS, leather seats, etc., constructors will multiply!
Car(String color, String engine, boolean sunroof, boolean gps, boolean leatherSeats) { ... }
```
❌ **Problem:** Too many constructor variations → Hard to maintain!

### **✅ With Builder (Simple & Scalable)**
```java
Car car = new CarBuilder()
            .setColor("Red")
            .setEngine("V8")
            .addSunroof()  // New feature added easily!
            .build();
```
🔹 **Why It Works?**  
- The **original code stays unchanged**.  
- New methods like `.addSunroof()` can be **added without breaking existing code**.  
- No need to modify or overload constructors.

---

## **2️⃣ Handling Step-by-Step Process Changes (Flexible 🔄)**  
🔹 **Scenario:** A **HouseBuilder** originally followed this order:
1️⃣ Build **foundation**  
2️⃣ Build **walls**  
3️⃣ Install **roof**  

🔹 **New Requirement:**  
- Now, the **roof should be added before the walls** (e.g., for modular construction).  

### **🔍 Without Builder (Hard to Change) ❌**  
- The **constructor forces a fixed order**.  
- You would need to **rewrite methods** to change the construction flow.

### **✅ With Builder (Rearrange Steps Easily)**  
- The **Builder allows step-by-step customization**.
- We can **reorder method calls** without breaking the structure.

```java
House house = new HouseBuilder()
                .buildFoundation()
                .installRoof()  // Roof is now installed before walls
                .buildWalls()
                .build();
```
✅ **Why It Works?**  
- Steps are **modular**, so **you can change the order easily**.  
- The original **HouseBuilder** remains usable **without modification**.

---

## **3️⃣ Adapting to New Product Variants (Extensible 🚀)**  
🔹 **Scenario:** A **PizzaBuilder** was originally designed for **Veg Pizzas only**.  
🔹 **New Requirement:** Customers want **Non-Veg Pizzas (Chicken, Pepperoni, etc.).**

### **🔍 Without Builder (Complicated) ❌**  
- The `Pizza` class needs **new constructors** for each variation.
- We might need **multiple subclasses** (`VegPizza`, `NonVegPizza`), leading to **code duplication**.

### **✅ With Builder (Easily Extendable)**
We can create **new specialized builders** without modifying the existing `PizzaBuilder`:
```java
class VegPizzaBuilder extends PizzaBuilder {
    public VegPizzaBuilder addCheese() { this.cheese = true; return this; }
}

class NonVegPizzaBuilder extends PizzaBuilder {
    public NonVegPizzaBuilder addChicken() { this.chicken = true; return this; }
}
```
🔹 **Why It Works?**  
- **No need to modify the original PizzaBuilder.**  
- New types (Veg, Non-Veg) can be added as **separate builders**.  
- **Open/Closed Principle:** The system is **open for extension but closed for modification**.

## **🎯 Summary: How Builder Pattern Evolves with Requirements**
| **Requirement Change** | **Without Builder (Problems) ❌** | **With Builder (Benefits) ✅** |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **New optional features** (e.g., Sunroof in Car) | More **constructor overloads** | Just **add a new method** |
| **Reordering build steps** (e.g., Roof before Walls) | Requires **restructuring methods** | Just **change method order** |
| **New product variations** (e.g., Non-Veg Pizza) | New **subclasses or constructors** | Create a **new builder subclass** |

---

## **Final Verdict 🏆**
✅ The **Builder Pattern adapts well to changing requirements** because:  
- It **avoids constructor overload problems**.  
- It **allows step-by-step changes without breaking old code**.  
- It **supports new product variations through builder extensions**.

## 19. How does the builder design pattern evolve with changes in requirements?
### **🚀 How the Builder Design Pattern Evolves with Changing Requirements**
One of the **biggest advantages** of the **Builder Design Pattern** is its ability to **adapt and evolve** as requirements change, making it highly **flexible and maintainable**.

---

## **🔹 How Builder Adapts to Requirement Changes**
| **Type of Change** | **Impact Without Builder** | **Impact With Builder** |
|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Adding new optional fields** | Requires modifying constructor, breaking existing code. | Simply add a new builder method without breaking existing code. |
| **Changing mandatory fields** | Requires modifying all constructor calls. | Only affects the builder’s `build()` method, keeping calling code intact. |
| **Introducing new configurations** | Requires multiple new constructors. | A new builder method easily adds configuration without clutter. |
| **Deprecating fields** | Requires refactoring constructor calls everywhere. | Mark the builder method as deprecated without breaking existing usage. |
| **Enhancing validation logic** | Requires modifying multiple constructors and adding validation. | Validation logic is encapsulated inside the builder, keeping objects clean. |

---

## **🔹 Example: Evolving a Builder with New Requirements**
### **Step 1: Initial Version**
A `Car` class with a **constructor** (without Builder).
```java
public class Car {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;

    public Car(String engine, int wheels) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.wheels = wheels;
    }
}
```
**🚫 Issue:** If a new feature (like `color`) is required, the constructor must be modified:
```java
public Car(String engine, int wheels, String color) { ... }
```
- ❌ Breaks existing calls.
- ❌ Requires code changes everywhere.

---

### **Step 2: Evolving to a Builder Pattern**
Using a builder **prepares for future changes**.

```java
public class Car {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;
    private String color;  // New field

    private Car(CarBuilder builder) {
        this.engine = builder.engine;
        this.wheels = builder.wheels;
        this.color = builder.color;
    }

    public static class CarBuilder {
        private String engine;
        private int wheels;
        private String color = "Black"; // Default value

        public CarBuilder(String engine, int wheels) {
            this.engine = engine;
            this.wheels = wheels;
        }

        public CarBuilder setColor(String color) {
            this.color = color;
            return this;
        }

        public Car build() {
            return new Car(this);
        }
    }
}
```
✅ **Advantage:** The new field `color` is **optional** and doesn’t break existing code.

**Usage:**
```java
Car car = new Car.CarBuilder("V8", 4)
                 .setColor("Red")
                 .build();
```
✔ The builder **easily adapts to new fields** without affecting old code.

---

### **Step 3: Further Evolution - Adding Advanced Features**
Let’s say **new features** (e.g., `GPS`, `sunroof`) need to be added.

```java
public class Car {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;
    private String color;
    private boolean hasGPS;
    private boolean hasSunroof;

    private Car(CarBuilder builder) {
        this.engine = builder.engine;
        this.wheels = builder.wheels;
        this.color = builder.color;
        this.hasGPS = builder.hasGPS;
        this.hasSunroof = builder.hasSunroof;
    }

    public static class CarBuilder {
        private String engine;
        private int wheels;
        private String color = "Black"; // Default
        private boolean hasGPS = false; // Default
        private boolean hasSunroof = false; // Default

        public CarBuilder(String engine, int wheels) {
            this.engine = engine;
            this.wheels = wheels;
        }

        public CarBuilder setColor(String color) {
            this.color = color;
            return this;
        }

        public CarBuilder setGPS(boolean hasGPS) {
            this.hasGPS = hasGPS;
            return this;
        }

        public CarBuilder setSunroof(boolean hasSunroof) {
            this.hasSunroof = hasSunroof;
            return this;
        }

        public Car build() {
            return new Car(this);
        }
    }
}
```
✅ **New features were added without modifying existing builder usages!**  
✅ **Backward compatibility is preserved.**  

---

### **Step 4: Adapting to Deprecated Features**
Let’s say **we no longer support `hasSunroof`**. Instead of removing it (which would break existing code), we **deprecate the method**.

```java
public static class CarBuilder {
    // Existing fields
    private boolean hasSunroof = false; 

    @Deprecated
    public CarBuilder setSunroof(boolean hasSunroof) {
        this.hasSunroof = hasSunroof;
        return this;
    }
}
```
✅ **Existing code continues to work, but developers are warned not to use `setSunroof()`.**

---

## **🔹 Summary: How Builder Evolves with Requirements**
| **Requirement Change** | **Without Builder (Constructor Approach)** | **With Builder Pattern** |
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Add new fields | Requires modifying all constructor calls. | Just add a new builder method. |
| Remove fields | Requires modifying/removing old constructor calls. | Mark builder method as `@Deprecated` without breaking code. |
| Set default values | Must update constructor logic. | Can be easily set in builder fields. |
| Add validation logic | Must update constructor, risking changes elsewhere. | Encapsulated in the `build()` method. |
| Support multiple configurations | Requires multiple constructors. | Builder allows flexible configurations. |

---

## **🚀 Conclusion**
The **Builder Pattern evolves smoothly** with **changing requirements** because:
- **✅ New fields can be added without breaking existing code.**
- **✅ Old features can be deprecated gradually.**
- **✅ Default values and validation logic remain encapsulated.**
- **✅ Custom configurations are easier to manage.**

The **Builder Pattern is a future-proof approach** to handling **growing and changing object requirements** in a **scalable, maintainable** way. 🚀
