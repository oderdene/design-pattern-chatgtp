**Corrected:** What is the primary intent of the Prototype design pattern?  

The primary intent of the Prototype design pattern is to create new objects by copying an existing object (prototype), improving performance and reducing the complexity of object creation.

## 2. What is the primary intent of the prototype design pattern?
The **Prototype Design Pattern** solves the problem of **creating new objects efficiently** when:  

1. **Creating from scratch is slow or complex** â€“ If making a new object takes a lot of time or resources, copying an existing one is faster.  
2. **Avoiding too many subclasses** â€“ Instead of making many different classes for each object variation, you can store a few prototypes and clone them when needed.  
3. **Objects should be created dynamically** â€“ If the exact type of object is only known at runtime, cloning lets you create objects without relying on complex logic.  

### **Example Problem It Solves:**  
Imagine youâ€™re designing a game with different characters. Instead of creating each one from scratch, you could have a few "prototype" characters and simply copy them to create new instances with small changes (like different weapons or armor). This makes object creation **faster** and **more flexible**.  



## 3. Is the prototype design pattern categorized as creational, structural, or behavioral? Why?
**Corrected:** Is the Prototype design pattern categorized as creational, structural, or behavioral? Why?  

The Prototype design pattern is categorized as **creational** because it focuses on creating objects efficiently by cloning an existing instance instead of constructing one from scratch.

The **Prototype Design Pattern** is categorized as a **Creational** pattern.  

### **Why?**  
Creational patterns focus on **how objects are created**, and the Prototype pattern helps in **creating objects by copying existing ones** instead of making them from scratch.  

Unlike **Structural patterns** (which focus on organizing relationships between objects) or **Behavioral patterns** (which focus on communication between objects), the Prototype pattern is all about **efficiently creating new objects**â€”which is why it belongs to the **Creational category**.
