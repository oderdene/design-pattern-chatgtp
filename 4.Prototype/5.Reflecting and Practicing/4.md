## 24. What questions remain unclear about the prototype design pattern after learning it?

Great question! After learning the **Prototype Design Pattern**, some common **uncertainties** might remain. Here are a few questions you might still have, along with simple explanations:  

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ When should I use Prototype instead of Factory Method?**  
- **Prototype is better** when object creation is **expensive** and you need many similar objects.  
- **Factory Method is better** when object creation logic is complex and varies based on parameters.  

üìå **Example:**  
- If you create **new user profiles** from scratch ‚Üí **Factory Method**  
- If you duplicate an **existing user template** and modify details ‚Üí **Prototype**  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ How does Prototype handle deep vs. shallow copies?**  
- **Shallow Copy (`copy.copy()`)** ‚Üí Only duplicates top-level attributes; nested objects are shared.  
- **Deep Copy (`copy.deepcopy()`)** ‚Üí Duplicates everything, including nested objects.  

üìå **Example:**  
```python
import copy

class Engine:
    def __init__(self, horsepower):
        self.horsepower = horsepower

class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, engine):
        self.model = model
        self.engine = engine

    def clone(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)  # Change to copy.copy(self) to test shallow copy

car1 = Car("Sedan", Engine(200))
car2 = car1.clone()

car2.engine.horsepower = 300  # Change cloned object's engine

print(car1.engine.horsepower)  # ‚ùì What happens here?
```
üîπ With **shallow copy**, `car1.engine.horsepower` will also change to `300`.  
üîπ With **deep copy**, `car1.engine.horsepower` remains `200`, since the engine is a separate object.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ How do I store and manage prototypes efficiently?**  
A **Prototype Registry** helps avoid creating unnecessary objects manually.  

üìå **Example:** Instead of creating new objects, store them in a dictionary and clone as needed.  
```python
class PrototypeRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self._prototypes = {}

    def register(self, key, prototype):
        self._prototypes[key] = prototype

    def clone(self, key):
        return self._prototypes[key].clone() if key in self._prototypes else None
```
üîπ This makes retrieving prototypes easier and keeps your code organized.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ What if my objects have dependencies on external resources (e.g., databases, APIs)?**  
- **Problem:** Cloning an object connected to a database may result in cloned objects keeping the same database connection.  
- **Solution:** Implement a **custom clone method** that resets these dependencies.  

üìå **Example:**  
```python
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection = "Connected to DB"

class User:
    def __init__(self, name, db_connection):
        self.name = name
        self.db_connection = db_connection

    def clone(self):
        cloned_obj = copy.deepcopy(self)
        cloned_obj.db_connection = DatabaseConnection()  # Reset connection
        return cloned_obj
```
üîπ This prevents cloned objects from interfering with the original database connection.  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Are there performance trade-offs in using the Prototype pattern?**  
Yes! While **Prototype can speed up object creation**, cloning deep structures **may use more memory** than directly constructing objects with a factory.  

üìå **Rule of Thumb:**  
‚úÖ **Use Prototype** when objects are complex but don‚Äôt require frequent modifications.  
‚ùå **Avoid Prototype** if cloned objects require **many changes**, as it might be better to use a **Factory Method** instead.
